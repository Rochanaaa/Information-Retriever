0,I was just 100% honest at a job interview,"So I just woke up and I had a phone interview with starling bank. I am so tired of lying in phone interviews just for a minimum wage job when everyone tells me “just be yourself” but that’s not true! Anyway I’m so fed up with interviews so I decided today is the day I fully test the be yourself theory. \nSo I’m sat with a coffee in a cafe- “why would you like to work with starling bank?” - well I need a job “what do you know about starling bank” - to be honest not much other than they’re a bank in my town , “what do you think the role involves” - answering phone calls and live chat “. “How would you do deal with emotive customers” - listen and understand and not add fuel to the fire but other than that there’s not much else I can do . \n“What attracts you to this role” - I need a reliable income\nShe ended the interview with “well I’ve got other interviews today so I’ll let you know” \nAyway I actually enjoyed it, it felt very uncomfortable and everyone in the cafe is staring at me but for fuck sake it’s minimum wage, I’m tired of selling myself - it’s humiliating to do continuously for minimum wage.",1alt3qe,249,1707389740
1,Do I just need to grow the f*ck up?,"I (30F) finished my engineering degree about 4 years ago. Since then I have switched jobs every 1/1.5 years. I enjoyed none of them and it was very difficult for me to show up every day and do the work. I either got too bored, anxious, depressed, annoyed, until I couldn't do the job anymore and I had to switch.\nThe fact that all the jobs were very different from one another (coding, lab, validation, tech support, regulation), makes me think that the problem is me. But I'm not sure. I've tried only 5 jobs, there's a whole wide world of jobs out there that I might like, right?\nI know my mental health players a big part of my dissatisfaction from work, and I've been working on it for the past 3 years. But I can't wait to 'feel better', I have to work right now to pay bills and rent.\n\nMy parents keep telling me to grow the f up, and that jobs aren't supposed to be fun, and that I have a nice salary and should be thankful for that.\n\nI try to think what bothered me in the jobs I did so I can choose a better one, but the answer was 'everything': deadlines, dealing with other people, owning big projects by myself, working on different tasks simultaneously. I feel like I suck at everything and I'll have a bad experience in every job.\n\nDoes anybody have any advice for me?",1altrbw,106,1707392284

4,Boss thinks I made a mistake but it was someone else. Should I set the record straight or take the fall?,"The issue was pretty minor, but my boss sent me an email afterward that was along the lines of “Hey, can you check this more carefully in the future?”\n\nI looked into what happened and can very clearly see that what I did was correct and the person who handles the next steps in the process made the error.\n\nHow do I handle this gracefully? I don’t want to come off as defensive or a tattle tale, but I also don’t want any mistakes other than my own to factor into my reputation. I take pride in being very careful and thorough. I’m also the newest employee at my job.\n\nEdit: Lots of great feedback here. I want to share a few more details.\n\nThe process was a very simple one. I filled out a form and entered a number correctly. When I passed it on to the next person they wrote a different number on whatever document they add to the packet. I feel like the suggestions to ask where I went wrong, or to go over the steps to help me learn, etc. will only make me look incompetent because it’s as simple as “my number’s right, Kevin’s is wrong.”\n\nMy boss is very kind and chill. The tone of the email was “Hey! Friendly reminder…”\n\nI work in accounting. So accuracy with numbers is very important to my position.",1aln3ay,35,1707365941
5,[UT] my boss hit on me,"I work remotely and we all got together at an event and went out to a bar afterwards. My boss got pretty sloppy drunk. I was also a little tipsy, nothing major. I helped my boss to the bathroom and she made a move on me and it left me feeling very uncomfortable. I ended up leaving and she then was calling me and texting me to try and get me to go back to her hotel room. I didn’t. I told her to hang up and go to bed she’s drunk. And then I ignored the rest of her calls and texts. \nI honestly just want to quit at this point. I don’t feel comfortable working under her anymore. But I also don’t want to communicate with her that I want to quit. Can I give my resignation to HR ? I honestly don’t want to communicate with my boss. Should I even go to HR? I feel like I was somehow in the wrong because I was also drinking. But I absolutely did not insinuate any of this to happen. Any advice?",1aloumj,18,1707371962

8,"Without Directly Relevant Experience, I Made It Into Banking and Almost Tripled My Income.","With no banking experience and in one long and difficult career move, I more than doubled (almost tripled) my income and moved into a great job that I love at the top business banks in my country. \n\nOver the 6 months that I made this move and worked every day on improving my chances at getting a job like this, I wanted to find something written by someone saying that I could do it. Giving me advice and seeing that it was done. This is for the next person who wants to back themselves and make this move. \n\nGo get them. \n\nI had 2 big red flags and one major road block: 1) I had no commercial banking experience and limited lending experience, and 2) I'd only worked for small businesses before and hadn't had to meet shareholder expectations. My roadblock was that I don't come from a background with lots of family contacts that could help, or from a wealthy background where my Dad could get me a job. None of my peers from school had gone onto something like this. I had to ignite the spark by myself\n\n\nHere's the take aways from my journey:\n\n1) Whilst my experience wasn't in banking, I could communicate my transferable skills smoothly and effortlessly. \n\nOut of uni (relevant banking degree) I worked in Commercial Real Estate. Tough gig but I did ok (nothing to write home about though). Then I worked for a mortgage broker in a small coastal town doing admin, and managed to work with a few clients and applications quickly. Not ideal experience for a business banker, but I was very good at relationship building and management, high-volume deal/pipeline management, negotiation and loved a deal. More importantly, I knew my what I was lacking. Which led me to part 2. \n\n2) I did a lot of reflection and knew my weaknesses very well. \n\nI knew what I was lacking. Along the 6 month journey of trying to get a job in banking I would have been knocked back over 60-70 times because of my lack of banking and lending experience. Most applications I didn't even get a phone call. But the few I progressed through for I very quickly missed out after not having the banking experience. So in order to show that these were non-issues you need to be proactive. \n\nMy lack of business lending - I did a 3 month course prior to me doing my job hunting (CFI Commercial Banking and Credit Analyst course [good course check it out]) and could communicate everything it taught me well. Not only that, but it helped me passed the BS test (checking I did know how to read financials and what they meant) in my second interview answering some quick fire questions. \n\nMy lack of corporate experience - I reached out to others I knew working corporate (mostly partner's family because I didn't have the contacts) and learnt the ins and outs of corporate life. \n\n3) I volunteer a lot. \n\nNot for the sake of getting a job, but I like giving back to the community. I'm very passionate about it, and I think this put a positive bias in the people reading my resume's mind. Shows I'm at least unlikely to be a dick. Also could help you meet people that could help you later down the track (foreshadowing)\n\n4) (Most important) - NETWORK. \n\nI can't stress this enough. This got me my job. You can probably do this with just going this well. You need to be thorough, ruthless, unashamed to ask for help and be the most enthusiastic, eager person they speak to all year. Not only this, but bring them along for the journey. Let them know your wins and when you lose, you can talk through your next step with them. \n\nMy contacts came from following up at a missed job opportunity (met the state manager of a bank through asking for more advice or other opportunities from the interviewer), an old volunteer bud from uni (he's an agri-banker at the bank I'm at now but he gave me the confidence boost I needed) and most importantly, one of the 'old guard' at the bank. Let's call him Steve. \n\nI met Steve 3 years ago at my best friend's Mums 50th. Briefly - I spoke to him for about 5min. But I scoured my memory for anyone that I had ever met that could help - I had to. He was my (stay with me) best friend's sister's now-fiance's Dad. I reached out to Steve on LinkedIn and had several phone calls with him. Post the 'here's my advice', I let him know everytime I got a win and everytime I got a loss. \n\nSteve really liked how keen I was and put my resume out to managers in the bank. He also put me in touch with someone in Talent Acquisition who I got very friendly with and made sure they knew I was grateful for any crumb of opportunity they laid at my feet. \n\nEventually between Steve and the Talent Acquisition person I got an interview, spoke to my strengths, weaknesses and (super important) my coach-ability and fast-paced learning. Two interviews later I got the job and they offered me over 30% higher salary than I asked for because they wanted to secure me without a shadow of a doubt, and show how much they back me. \n\nIf you're on this journey and feeling alone and like others have a better head start in this race, you're probably right. They probably do. But a great amount of tenacity, patience and resilience (I think I would've got about 70 rejections all up and applied to over 100 jobs easily) can overcome this and change your life for the better.",1alvrxz,9,1707399122
9,Unemployed since Sept. of 2023 - I have a Masters Degree worth nothing,"Hi all, I am a (35 M) I live in Oregon USA.\n\nI have been a bike mechanic for the past decade and later on in my career I was doing more R&D and Design and product development on the ebike segment. Got my Master of Public Administration degree from ASU. (Really wanted to be in charge of a bicycle infrastructure for a city but after I graduated I realized I despise bureaucracy and I do not want to be a number for the government. As of June of 23, I was working for a ebike company launching their flagship Oregon store and they fired me because of no good reasons. Now I am unemployed. I run a small online innertube and tire company on Amazon that I started in 2023 but it has done a complete nose dive. The products I have been selling can no longer command the same $, and I do not have a reliable income from it. Need more $ to buy inventory and credit cards are maxed. Only 2K or so. Not the worst. I have not made my student loan payments because I am not bringing in any money. Probably owe another 1500 in back taxes. UGH. I have applied to countless jobs, but I have a feeling employers think I am overqualified and will jump ship if I get a better opportunity. \n\nI have been busy trying to make it in other ways. In JAN of this year, I recently wrote my first book for young people on opening a business vs going to college, helping them weigh options. Has not sold one copy yet.\n\nI am also a musician, put out my first album last year and 5 subsequent singles- but have not been getting the streams I would have liked. Certainly not enough to even buy lunch with. I have another album on the way. I still have recording equipment and a release subscription \n\nI also am bootstrapping a startup. I have designs, a patent pending. Currently I have been looking for a cofounder every single day, putting in between two and three hours of networking research. Also recently go rejected from Y combinator.\n\nYesterday I applied to 3 jobs, and most of my days look the same. \n\nNot sure how to go on. \n\nMy girlfriend really wants to get pregnant and I have zero income. I am going to be posting a ton of things to Facebook marketplace today and see how that goes. I know this seems like I’m complaining but I’m curious what the hell is wrong with me.\n\nI have skills and sales and operations and mechanics and in customer service. I do not have any certifications yet. I am $56,000 in debt for a Masters degree I don’t use.\n\nPlease help me weigh my options\n\nI should have become a plumber",1alca89,2817,1707336523
10,Why Corp Strategy as an exit?,"I need help understanding why people choose Corp Strategy exits from MBB/Big 4. \n\nFrom networking conversations, it seems like:\n\n* All the stress of consulting thanks to working with former consultants who behave like they're still consulting, tight timelines, project fragmentation, etc.\n* A minimal reduction in hours (\\~55-65 with very rare 70+ is what most people tell me)\n* Dramatically lower comp/benefits\n* Far slower career progression.\n\nThere's clearly some benefits I'm not seeing here because as a 24 month post-MBA at MBB, I can't think of any reason I'd trade what I do for Corp Strategy. This is also a real question; I'm still waiting on a promo decision and need to consider exits. \n\nMaybe it's because I'm only talking to Fortune 500 folks that I'm getting a skewed view? Is life better in this function at startups or smaller firms?",1alihrp,87,1707352276

14,CC Etiquette in consulting,"I have been in consulting for about 5 years but something I keep stumbling over is when to cc who. I mean it's easy after a meeting if you want to send around meeting notes or if it's just a normal exchange of information, but then there are situations where it feels wrong because CCs can be passive aggressive, annoying or a breach of trust I suppose.\n\nFor example, if you're reminding a client of a task or a request for information where there were several people in the original request email. When I come back to it, would I cc everyone who was in the original email? Because that feels like public shaming. \n\nAnother example is if you have people in a long email threat that evolves so that the information becomes less and less relevant to them. For example, if there is a person on the client side who is needed for a task, but then the task is completed and they may no longer be interested, do I message them individually to ask if it's OK to remove them from the thread, or am I overcomplicating it?\n \nAnother situation I can think of is when I'm talking to partner A about a project or task they're asking me to do in the future, and I know it might affect the project I'm working on for partner B if it gets extended. Should I cc partner B in my conversation with partner A? In my experience, these partners are often in competition with each other and do not like too much transparency about plans with other partners. So in this situation I would prefer to talk to each partner separately rather than cc'ing people, which could reveal that I discussed something with partner A that partner B should not know.\n\nIn general, I wonder about the level of transparency that should be maintained in consulting, because I believe in being very transparent, but my experience is that people don't appreciate it because of competition for resources or knowledge sovereignty over the projects or social networks they're working on. So I often feel stuck in the middle, and I often feel that it would be easier to talk to people individually, but then I have to manage multiple email streams, which seems inefficient.",1als3ek,12,1707385434
15,Didn't realise that the trial day I worked was unpaid.,"Did 11 hours work for a delivery company. It was a salaried position worth 55k a year. After the long day was over, I had my exit interview with the deputy manager of the business. As far as I could tell everything went very well. He was singing my praises throughout and the guy I was riding along with gave me a 9 out of 10 on his report sheet. The manager told me when the interview concluded that he is very happy to offer me the position and HR would be reaching out within the week with employment papers. \n\nI was so happy because I have been broke and job hunting since November. Anyways, 2 weeks go by and I hear nothing. So I called them up and asked to speak to HR. They told me I was not selected and they wish me well blah blah corporate blah. So then I asked her would I be recieving a check in the mail. She told me it was an unpaid trial day.\n\nTurns out, when I showed up to work on that morning, they handed me a 25 page booklet that I had to sign the last page on. It was mostly safety stuff, do you consent to staying sober etc. I was reading it infront of the manager, HR and the guy who was riding along with me. I really felt pressured to sign and just get the ball rolling. Turns out somewhere buried underneath 25 pages of legal jargen, was a waiver that I wouldnt be paid. Its technically my fault, but I feel so fucked over. This whole trial shift day seems like they intentionally screwed me and knew they were not gonna hire me from the get go. \n\nI am so fucking sick of the way I have been treated by US companies.

17,[KY] Office gossip is stressing me out and causing hardship.,"My company purchased and absorbed a competitor around 5 years ago. Everything before then was great where I worked, teamwork, everyone getting along, etc. \n\nThat changed. So much toxicity came with the employees/culture from the other company. They had cliques, backstabbing, it was awful. They ran, not exaggerating, half of our original team off in the first year. Morale was awful. It took the company over a year and a half before they investigated, and removed the ring leader from their power/a job. \n\nThings started to settle after that, I became a supervisor over a pretty solid team, but anonymous complaints have been made to HR ever since. \n\nNow to my situation. \n\nI'm married, have been for almost 10 years. I love my wife, I love my home life, I loved my job. Office gossip started pairing up 'couples' if they thought you talked to someone too long, was having around too long, etc. Unfortunately, I fell into that crossfire with a coworker. Just a coworker if a different department, I have no authority over her or her department. Totally unrelated. \n\n \nShe has a bad background/home life, and I'd let her vent to me. No inappropriate touching, speaking, no touching in general, no hugs, nothing. I felt bad for her and just have her an ear. Everyone can use someone who will just listen every now and again. Never spent time together outside of work, never communicated outside of the office. \n\nCoworkers started gossiping saying we had a thing, she got pregnant and had a procedure to not be pregnant anymore, etc. I heard second hand from a coworker who was hearing it. Was approached by another one to get members of my team in control because they are saying x, y, and z. I tried to ignore it cause it's just people with nothing better to do. \n\nOver a year ago, someone messaged my wife. Told her it all. She ignored it, but asked me because it kept weighing on her. I said it's not true, I'd take a lie detector test, etc. It was turbulent. My wife's self confidence isn't what it should be. She's always down on herself and I try my best to lift her up. We've both gained weight since our wedding, me more so than her, and she started believing what was told to her. \n\nI released my work and personal phone to her. She went through emails, texts to the girl, it all came up clean. I put a tracking app on my phone and gave her access to it. She can track my like a UPS package, she says. I don't care because I have nothing to hide. She knows my passcode and is free to look through my phones anytime. \n\nI told my boss I was going to look for another job if he didn't get the office in check. He was upset, said he doesn't need any more HR complaints and would handle it. A year later nothing has changed. \n\nI've kept my distance from the coworker, in fact any female coworker, morale and teamwork is down again. I've lost my love for my job and currently looking for another. \n\nI'm stressed out every day, scared someone will message my wife and just start drama again. Our relationship is much better. But she still has moments where intrusive things take control. We ride them out though. \n\nA coworker recently told me my boss was laughing at a joke another coworker made at my expense, about myself and the female coworker taking the same day off last Monday. My wife took the day off as well, and we were together the entire day and night. My location is on a tracker and my house cams show I never left. I didn't even know the coworker took that day. \n\nMy stress has been getting the better of me, i lashed out at an inconvenience at work a month ago, not at a person, but someone reported me to HR for saying Damn and i got written up yesterday. Im just so deflated. Is there anything I can do to protect myself/my job?

Once we were in a meeting and i was trying to give my opinion, he immediately shut me down by saying “you, shut up right now.”\n2. I was having a discussion with him and was trying to explain why the work assigned to me could not be done within the timelines he has given. He literally said “dont talk bullshit. Tell me the reason why you dont want to do it.” \n3. Other teammates get their leaves approved immediately with no questions asked but whenever i apply for any leave, i’m told to plan my leaves accordingly or else i will have to work on weekends and at night. Even though i take the least number of leaves in my team. \n4. He keeps saying all the time that you will get no increment if you dont get this xyz work done. \n5. He somehow got to know that i’m trying to switch to other team and told me that he will not approve my transfer and that will give very bad review that other manager will himself back out from taking me into his team.\n6. There are few people who lied to my manager about something and he came shouting at me and told me that i’m arrogrant and why am i not helping other teammates. He did not even care listening to my side of story. I somehow managed to tell him that the other person lied to him and showed him all the proofs. He immediately changed the topic and told me to stop dragging the topic.\n\nThere are a lot more incidents and it has been bothering me for a while now. This guy is very clever. He has never given anything in writing or said anything on record. All these incidents happened over calls which were not recorded. \n\nWhat can i do to teach this jerk a lesson?

Is this something i can bring up during my 1 on 1?,"I work for a fairly small tech startup and this past year we doubled up in numbers: from 15 to 40 people.\n\nWhen i first joined there were 10 of us and we did the standard startup process where we would meet for 30 mins everyday. But as the company grew, our CTO still wanted everyone to join in the startup, doubling the time from 30-mins to 1 hr because he wanted the devs to raise any concerns (bugs, broken codes) they have on the meeting and they would talk about fixing it.\n\nIt got to a point that it was too long so he only made it 2 times a week (mon and thurs) with respective teams meeting on their own. Team members aren't required to join the thurs call as the team leader will be the one presenting. But recently he's been bugging my team to attend the optional thurs call for no reason at all. He just saw some other members join and realized he wanted all of us there, even though we have a seperate stand up with him the same day in the afternoon.\n\nThe 1.5-2 hr calls are honestly so unproductive because 80% of the topics don't even relate to my team and most of it are the devs concerns.\n\nI have an upcoming 1 on 1 with the COO and is this something i can bring up without making it look like i'm bypassing the CTO?

32,Private or Public: Which opportunity to pursue?,"\rI am a fresh graduate with Latin honors (cum laude), with 6 months of part-time job experience as a pharmacy assistant during and after my internship.\r  \n\r  \nI recently passed my board exam just this November and I aimed to apply right away for an entry-level plantilla position (Pharmacist II) at a government hospital. However, there were only 4 open positions available. In line with my application, I passed their first screening, qualifying exams, and actual performance evaluation, which took me 4 months to complete until I reached their final stage of screening. Initially, there were a total of 21 applicants who took the exams, but it was narrowed down to 14 of us who underwent performance evaluation. Now, the remaining 14 applicants, including myself, are about to undergo the interview, which is the last step of their recruitment process before receiving a job offer.\r  \n\r  \nDue to my doubts about my chances of getting into government service due to factors such as being a fresh graduate, limited years of experience, and lack of connections, I sought a backup plan by applying to a private hospital (Level II) in the same location. It's one of the leading private hospitals in the city, and I got accepted after passing their exams and interviews. However, there's a catch: in order to be finally hired, I have to undergo a 2-week training with no pay (only provided with free lunch and transportation allowance), then I will work as a probationary employee for 6 months (earning around ₱14k-₱15k monthly), and after another 6 months, I may be regularized with a potential salary increase (up to <₱18k). Additionally, after passing the 2-week training, I would have to sign a minimum 24-month contract, and there would be a fine if I break it. However, they promised comprehensive training to enhance my skills in various areas and assured that they would cover all expenses for convention training or CPD training.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem is that my training in the private sector and interview in the public sector fall in the same week. Let's say, the training starts on Feb 19, and the interview at the government hospital is scheduled for Feb 21.\r  \n\r  \nQuestions:\r  \n\r  \nIf you were in my situation, how would you strategically and realistically approach it?\r  \n\r  \nIs it acceptable to accept the 24-month contract knowing that there is potential for professional growth with the private hospital, or should I continue to hope for an opportunity at the government hospital instead?\r  \n\r  \nWhat is the probability or likelihood that a government agency will accept fresh graduates and recently board-passed individuals? (Some of my fellow applicants have over 3 years of experience in the field, and one of them was even my professor before. Also, some of them are fresh graduates like me)\r  \n\r  \nSuppose I still wanted to attend the interview at the government hospital just to gain experience and insight into what to expect if given the chance to reapply again. What would be a suitable excuse to give to the private sector to be excused from training on that day?\r  \n\r  \nAssuming the universe favors me greatly this year and I am lucky enough to be selected from the 4 positions the government agency is offering, how would I handle this situation, knowing that I am still undergoing training in the private sector?\r  \n\r  \nConsidering realistic possibilities, what is the best course of action given the factors at play in this situation?\r  \n\r  \nThank you so much!

Just my suspicion\n\nExamples\n\n1. Remove the word “close”. The statement was “close in proximity” not sure what is wrong with the sentence structure. \n\n2. Reword section from “Selected Benchmark” to “Sub-market Benchmark” which was the original before he made me change it. Now I have to change it again\n\n3. The worst one - he made me change the format of the company issued template because “it was hurting his eyes, it makes me feel sick”\n\nI’m sorry to rant maybe I’m new but this is just ridiculous and the list goes on and on.

Since I work as a software developer, I would look at git or older tickets. I know how to help myself.\n\n  \nBut there are some tasks where that's not possible.  We have a lot of internal company processes and programs. I can't google them, and if I did and found something, they would have a problem.

I feel like a painter and the client tells me to paint the wall, but doesn't tell me which color, how he wants it ....\n\n  \nI have tried writing down questions and sending them to him in emails, I am trying to be patient, but I am so angry at the moment.  I accept my mistake if it is something I should know. But with this company's internal processes, it is impossible to learn a new task by myself.

I have also tried to tell him this in a constructive way, and he agreed it's hard. \n\nHow can i professional improve this situation or me.

59,My partner was fired. What should he say in a job interview?,"Let me preface this by saying that he made mistakes in the beginning of the job, his manager said he had poor performance and threatened a PIP, told him he was going to do a PIP but didn't because he said 'I know you have it in you' ... my partner worked really hard the following months trying to learn and keep busy, never got put on a PIP, was told in his performance review that his performance was better towards the end of the year, got a raise and everything then a few weeks later he was fired unexpectedly. When he asked why HR basically said performance reasons. He kinda feels like nothing was ever good enough for his ex manager. The thing is, they gave him a severance package, it was like 1 month pay. But now how is he supposed to disclose this at future interviews? Does he just say laid off? I feel like if he says he was fired many employers will be turned off from that altogether. HR told him that they are a 'neutral reference'. Any feedback is appreciated",1alige7,94,1707352166

62,Boss thinks I made a mistake but it was someone else. Should I set the record straight or take the fall?,"The issue was pretty minor, but my boss sent me an email afterward that was along the lines of “Hey, can you check this more carefully in the future?”\n\nI looked into what happened and can very clearly see that what I did was correct and the person who handles the next steps in the process made the error.\n\nHow do I handle this gracefully? I don’t want to come off as defensive or a tattle tale, but I also don’t want any mistakes other than my own to factor into my reputation. I take pride in being very careful and thorough. I’m also the newest employee at my job.\n\nEdit: Lots of great feedback here. I want to share a few more details.\n\nThe process was a very simple one. I filled out a form and entered a number correctly. When I passed it on to the next person they wrote a different number on whatever document they add to the packet. I feel like the suggestions to ask where I went wrong, or to go over the steps to help me learn, etc. will only make me look incompetent because it’s as simple as “my number’s right, Kevin’s is wrong.”\n\nMy boss is very kind and chill. The tone of the email was “Hey! Friendly reminder…”\n\nI work in accounting. So accuracy with numbers is very important to my position.",1alnazi,44,1707366640
63,Should I switch from a stable income job to a commission based job?,"Seriously need some advice. F22, preschool teacher. Started my full time job 2 years ago. USD 3000 per month. I have skipped a few grades as a kid, so I have a diploma in early childhood education, and degree in counselling at my age.\n\nWhat is important for me in a job:\n\n1. Well-paid (higher than USD7500 per month)\n2. Work-life balance (for my future kids)\n3. Something I have interest in\n4. Something I am good at\n5. Good reputation (meaning no financial advisor, or jobs that people shun from, because people usually avoid meeting friends who are financial advisors for the fear that they will try to turn a social meeting to a business meeting)\n\nI like the sense of satisfaction I get from my job, but it's so tiring having to deal with children with special needs for a meagre salary. I know I am getting a higher pay as compared to the market rate in the industry (US 2300), but it doesn't feel enough with the work I do, and the stress I go through.\n\nProbably also because I know some people who tick 4 or even all of the requirements in my above list. They are well paid, doing what they are interested in, with a work-life balance. It made me feel that if they can do it, why can't I?\n\nIdeally, I would want to work as a real estate agent. Friends in real estate have ticked all 5 of the above. Their working hours are quite similar to mine, weekday afternoons even. Their weekends are not packed. \n\nConsiderations that are stopping me:\n1. Real estate is commission based. One comment I have been getting at my job is 'You look very young' even when I try to dress maturely to look the part. I am afraid that clients will take one look at me, and not want to engage me as they have no faith in a 'kid'. I am still paying for my house with my partner (prices are crazy expensive) which amounts to USD 750 per month on my end. Not having a steady income is scary as I am afraid that I cannot pay for my house. We also want to have a child in 2 years time, so having the security of a steady income is important. I don't want to push back the plan to have kids. I will need to pay till I am 26 (2028).\n\n2. I considered switching to counselling before I go into real estate in 2028 as I have a degree in counselling, and it is something I have interest in, with about the same pay as my current job, but more work life balance, shorter working hours, and more PTO (paid time off). However, I am at my 3rd job since working full-time for the past 2 years. I don't want to have the reputation as someone who keeps changing jobs. Not a good impression for employers, and my family. \n\n\nBefore you ask:\n1. I know 24 (in 2026) is young to have kids, and you may think I am rushing, but my husband is 5 years older than me. We have been together since I was 18, and we are in a healthy relationship. He earns about USD 4200 per month\n\n2. Left my first job in 2 months due to management. The turnover rate was so high. It got so bad that the government had to step in. They also ruled that the employer was at fault. Left my 2nd job after a year, as I was doing the job of 3 teachers, with a pay that was lower than the market rate, and a toxic boss who gaslights me. I have been working for 7 months now at my 3rd workplace. Across all my workplaces, I have been a high performer, scoring awards, training new staff, and got promoted to senior teacher at my 2nd job due to how well I did my job. I would always work overtime unpaid to do my job to the best of my ability, and always earned praises from higher ups. So no, I was not a low performer. But I am afraid that on the outside, it may seem like I am quitting my job because I give up easily. Asian family things, afraid of what they would think of me. When I revealed that I was changing to my 3rd job, most of them said, 'Huh? Again?' I feel like I am giving them the impression that I am someone with no grit and gives up easily. So I am afraid that if I switch to counselling now (temp job till 2028), the impression will be worse.\n\nSo I guess my dilemma is if I should:\n1. Stay in my stable yet mentally draining preschool teacher job. Everyone will approve as my pay is higher than the market rate, and I am good at my job, and I am interested in it. \n\n2. Switch to be a counsellor till my finances settle in 2028. About the same pay but with better work life balance and PTO. I have interest in counselling. May not be a good impression on future employers, and most importantly, my Asian family for changing jobs too many times (may view me as someone who gives up easily)\n\n3. Switch to be a real estate agent now. High commission, may even earn USD 7000 or more per month. But commission based. I believe I can speak well, but first impressions matter. I have what they call a baby face, and people usually think I am still in middle school. So I am afraid that there will be a lack of trust during the transaction, which may cost my commission. I may have to risk not being able to pay the mortgage for my house for some months, which is scary. OR it could be good for me and my earnings per month will be high. Can go either way. But I am honestly not interested in real estate. I prefer to do things that can make a real impact on people and help them. So I am only considering this job for the money.",1als7g4,3,1707385909

70,FMLA [IN] [WA] Not eligible b/c dying parent is inpatient?,"Hi there, \n\nMy mom lives in a memory care facility. She’s on hospice care there and has transitioned to the dying process. I asked HR at my company if I can use FMLA to be with my mom until she passes. \n\nThey said 'FMLA is for serious medical conditions only.' When I asked if dying is considered a serious medical condition, they said I don’t qualify because my mom is inpatient under 24/7 care, which means I’m not the primary caregiver. \n\nI looked at the FMLA form and don’t see any restrictions around that. I would be selecting the 'psychological comfort' checkbox in section II, part 3, because that’s what I’m literally doing. I spent 11 hours yesterday at her bedside, holding her hand and talking to her. \n\nHowever, hospice says she likely will pass in the next few days. My employer requires employees to use PTO concurrent with FMLA. I have 6 days of PTO accrued. I guess I could just avoid the FMLA hassle and not request FMLA. \n\nBut, I’m concerned because we really don’t know when my mom will pass. What if it’s weeks? \n\nI also just do not want to be dealing with this right now. I don’t want to have to fight for FMLA if it comes down to that—I can’t imagine doing that while dealing with my mom dying. I don’t know what to do. I’m exhausted and my brain isn’t working right.

As an example a vendor is interested in selling a saas to the client. As a project manager I have been involved in this from the start following the clients recomend approach and process together with the vendor stretching over a year preparing contract to meet interest of both parties. We have mapped a high level service design, defined a project plan, performed cyber security check and prepared a data protection agreement, figured out needed integrations, scope etc all together with the vendor. In this case the vendor wasn’t a perfect fit for the client. They constantly went back to business to complain the process took long questioned need to perform cyber security check as an example. How do you deliver the bad news? I feel sorry for the vendor but hey I know my strength and weakness is empathy. This vendor is a bit tricky to deal with and some stakeholders have recommended us to remove them earlier. Vendor is extremely detail oriented, not very structured, has been late to meetings, forgotten meetings and as mentioned above escalated security checks prior to signing contract. Yet business have been completely sold on the GUI of their product. The work was to be at no obligation to the client (communicated in advance). What do we do if they (vendor) start a fight or even cry in the call? I mean what if they start claiming they should have money for doing basic prep.. it was a constant debate with them that I never experienced with any other vendor. ",1alxcli,1,1707403647

77,Job didn’t promote me but manager is all of a sudden keen to give me tasks at the level above me,"I don’t get it. This was supposed to be a rotational two year program when I applied. Against better judgment, I stayed when three weeks before I started, they removed the rotation component. I didn’t get in the department I wanted, but was told that we can switch after a year. A year comes by and it’ll be a regular transfer instead of a simple, “hey, can I join the new cohort”\n\nI was told you “graduate” when you reach account manager. So, two promotions. The LinkedIn data supported that promotions happened on a yearly basis. The first promotion cycle was around 6 months ago and the new one was a week ago. Of the 20 people I joined with, I believe I am one of two-three that were not promoted, but I can’t confirm exact counts as they’re not all in my specific team, just in the same department, so I’m mostly seeing who had their title changed on teams. \n\nMy first one on one since this happened was yesterday and my manager asked if I had taken over for my account manager on one study for the interviews (I work in market research, mostly quant, the interviews are qual and done infrequently )and I’m majorly confused as that is a stretch opportunity for the level above me. And she looked confused when I told her no. I eventually got her to back off when I told her it was a new important segment for the client , so not the normal ones we do maybe once or twice a year. \n\nShe also messaged me today asking about me doing a presentation on the monthly call for our entry level program. Again, that’s a task for the level above me, so I just say yes, but still confused. Not everyone who had gotten promoted had ever given a promotion, again, it’s for the level above us mostly as a presentation requirement.\n\nI feel slighted that I was not promoted when everyone else was. It makes me feel like they’re saying my work is not valued. Now, these above level tasks are cropping up and I’m not sure what to do. \n\nBackground:\nI got feedback 6 months ago and my manager admitted that some of it sounded like “personal differences” as I received negative feedback that said I didn’t ask enough questions and in the next sentence asked too many questions. I know who wrote it as the same account manager for some reason refused to cc me on client emails and got annoyed with me when there would be three different things for the client due within 24 hours that sounded vaguely the same, but were in fact different things. Besides that, I took note of some of the more useful feedback such as some of the account managers didn’t like that I waited until the end to ask questions and have been trying to do my job. My projects have gotten good feedback from clients, I pretty much took over several studies from busy account managers and those who were too “expensive” to spend too much time with it. I feel like I did my job, but apparently, that wasn’t enough. Now, I’m getting even more antsy as I have no work and how many billable hours you work is also a major component of promotions, but my manager told me there were no new projects, so literally half of my time is spend helping other people and still not reaching my rate. Also, my grand boss when I talked to him two weeks ago(this was probably when most people realized they were getting promoted, except me) he said they were hiring new people, but no projects? \n\nAnyway, I was waiting on our annual reviews later this month to bring it up. What’s the best way to go about it?",1allnq6,4,1707361468

86,Am I rude for thinking this?,"I’ve had a job for about 8 months. A coworker who has been here almost ten years is leaving for a better and higher paying job. Someone else wants everyone to pay $15 to get her a going away gift, throw a party for her at work and also take her out to dinner and pay for our own stuff. Am I wrong for not wanting to pay the $15? I barely know her, she was on maternity leave for 2/3 months out of the 8 I’ve been here. I heard a snarky comment from the women collecting the money saying I haven’t paid yet. Every other gift we collected for, has been $5 per person, for example, a get well gift for someone who broke her ribs in a car accident, flowers for someone’s mom who died. I feel like $15 for someone leaving is ridiculous. Any advice?",1aleo5o,207,1707342478

92,Disability accomodation for software engineer [CA],"\nHi--\n\nI'm coming to terms that I may have multiple disabilities and I wanted to get some advice from this community.  For some background I'm a software engineer and can definitely do my job entirely at home and have done so through the pandemic.  Over the last couple years I've gone back to the office 2 to 3 times per week.  I've dealt with some mental / physical issues during that time including taking short term sick leave but still tried to come into the office diligently despite issues.  But at this time, I feel like it would be best to wfh and I'd like to ask for an accomodations for that.  \n\nI'm hesitant to do that though because post-covid, lots of people want to wfh and I don't want to seem like I fall into the same camp.  But for a bit more context, I've been at my company almost 7 years and been promoted 4 times.  Twice since COVID and also gotten some awards for going above and beyond.\n\nI guess I'm hesitant to possibly lose the political power I have in my job by disclosing a disability and also asking for an accomodation.  According to others, the company has denied many accomodations but obviously I don't know exactly the issue except I do know there was a huge increase once RTO was announced.  I'm hoping since I've been RTO for the past couple years without issue, that might be taken into account.  But also -- there's been a lot more scrutiny due to RTO and with the down market, not keen to rock the boat.  Any advice and insight would be appreciated very much.",1alovh6,0,1707372036

94,Is the commute worth it?,"**Seeking some advice! I** applied for this job working for the City near me. The position is as a recreation leader- youth/teens program. The pay is all right $19-21 and its part-time no more than 20 hours. I got an email back to schedule an interview which also gave me an address of where the interview would be and where I'd be working. It is a 24 min drive from and but since I use public transport, it would be 2 hours and 10 mins.

Basically I said that to the extent of my knowledge, it was not possible but she can confirm further details.\n\nThe thing is, had I asked her, she would have responded with “you already know the answer” or “you should know that already.” It’s a senior account, and she knows the SOW better than I do. I thought I did the right thing but apparently not.\n\nAnyways, I want to tell her I won’t do it again, but the reason I didn’t ask her in the first place is because she’s treating everyone else like shit.

101,[IL]Is this retaliation? What are my best options?,"Hi everyone! It’s unfortunate I have to write this out but alas here I am.\n\nI am currently a FT corporate recruiter and a FT Master’s student in a clinical counseling program. For our Master’s program we have to complete a clinical internship. When I first joined the practice I am\nat (will refer to as TPS) the team\nof supervisors was aware that I work\nfulltime and were willing to work with my schedule and things started off great. A couple to few months into internship my original clinical supervisor (will call him J) and the owner of TPS made some uncomfortable and alarming comments to me during a supervision call. \n\nHe essentially was angry about another situation and took his feelings out on me stating “You have a fuck you face on and I’m going to need you to fix your face right now.” To which I replied, shocked and uncomfortable, that I wasn’t trying to have a fuck you face and just listening to him intently. This caused a rupture in our supervisor-supervisee relationship basically since then. I reported the incident to\nmy school supervisors, my\nsecondary supervisor at the practice, and then his HR manager (who is also his wife) had to get involved. We came\nup with a plan to resolve the issue and I was sent that via email.\n\nHowever, he did not abide by that plan and continued to be rude to\nme during supervision, calling me names, speaking over me, raising his voice, etc. I had an additional two meetings with our HR manager about this. Finally, they hired an additional licensed supervisor and transferred me to her. A few weeks go by and I’m thinking everything is fine. Then I am told by one of the secondary supervisors (we will call her D) that J was telling everyone during an all supervisors meeting that I am the one that was causing trouble, swearing, not listening, not putting enough hours in, etc and that I am getting put on a PIP.\n\nIs this grounds for a retaliation case?

102,How I finally got a job,"Graduated with a masters in finance, finished a year long internship August 2023. (opted for a year long to take a break). Ever since the internship ended I've been applying like mad. I got a few final stage interviews but did not pass simply because I am shite at it.  The company I interned at was 4 hours away so I WHM.  I started looking into roles within my city.  The sector I am pursuing work in is very niche so there are only a handful of roles available.  I applied for a position after my internship in a company that I felt I was a perfect fit for.  It was my ideal location and everything.   To my surprise, I got rejected by an automated mail.  I was sure I would receive at least a screening call. but no.  I applied again a couple of weeks later with a different email.  Same result.  Applied again with another email.... the same result.  I could not understand why.  My CV is great.  Maybe there are weird formatting issues that the algos picked up on?? idk.\n\nSo I started to get curious as to are they even hiring because they had the position open for a couple of months.  I added lots of people on LinkedIn from the company, including hiring managers to ask what the story is out of pure frustration.  To my surprise, one person decided to refer me.  He sent my CV to his manager and I got an interview scheduled the next morning.  I just received an offer today.  So yeah...\n\nHad no intention of applying again, all I did was ask if they were even hiring out of pure frustration and i guess that got me the job.  Is this what networking is? loll.  It took 5 god damn months to find anything.  However, it is to be said i botched numerous interviews prior.\n\nI have no clue why my cv kept on getting rejected by this companybut oh well.

104,Got publicly frustrated at work after I was passed up for a promotion. Advice?,"I confess, I lost my temper at work and was very unprofessional. The background is that this is my first job and my manager told me last year that he planned to put me up for a promotion if things go well this year. So I slogged really hard and got good reviews all year round. They'd say my work was the best, no one else does the job as well as I do. Most importantly, my supervisor and manager both kept reassuring me in my 1-on-1 that I was the best out of those eligible, and it was objecive based on the work done. Especially, there's this one guy who they said I was loads better than, since we are direct 'rivals' for the promotion, given we started at the same time (but he's slightly younger).\n\nCome 2024, I realise that this other guy got a hush hush 'special' promotion, where he's branded as a high flyer for the corporation and will have direct contact with the senior execs. And as for my 'normal' promotion, my manager has been dropping hints like 'we can't guarantee anything. Is it so bad if you wait a few more years? What are you rushing for? You have to stop thinking about money and progression, think about what you can learn here'.\n\nI don't doubt the other guy who got the promotion. It was pretty obvious on hindsight they were grooming him because I had to keep looking for high visibilty opportunities to showcase myself but he often had high visibility posts given to him.\n\nWhat I was upset about was that I felt baited. Previously my supervisor and manager kept insisting to me that I was better than this guy. So I held out quitting the job to get the promotion first. But when I asked them about it, they suddenly changed their tune, saying 'you're just an average staff', 'that guy is better', 'we should be content with what we have'. They just feigned that they'd never made those remarks about me being better when I questioned them and I felt so dumb since I never had anything in writing. Another supervisor said my manager was just baiting me because I was good at the technical role and now that they've hired someone else, we're no longer short on manpower and they don't need to pacify me.\n\nSo during my last 1 on 1 I pretty much had a very defeatist attitude, like 'what does it matter' and hinting I wouldn't be here for long, when they talked about planning my goals. (And what still grinds my gears, as petty as it is, was my supervisor looking me in the eyes and condescendingly saying 'you need to take this in stride, you need to be more resilient and focus on what you can learn'.) And I couldn't hide how upset I was and I did the bare minimum for my work, went home, and I'm sure it was obvious, since I always put in so much effort in my work to make it easier for my manager. Usually I will propose additional ideas or argue for my work hence the meeting to discussion, but I just did the edits as I was instructed to. **So my supervisor scheduled for our 1 on 1 to be brought a week forward as he felt I was demotivated and I'm very sure my manager was informed about my attitude since he was making similar remarks.**\n\nIt's been a week and I'm still upset, though I'm trying not to be. And I think my manager himself is upset at me too for my attitude, since he maybe genuinely doesn't remember the things he said, he has helped me a lot in the past for my previous pay raise and technically, they never promised me the 'special' promotion. I was just the one who jumped to conclusions thinking that because they said I was the best out of the lot, I would be the first in line for any promotions. On my 'normal' promotion, I can't get a clear answer on whether I'll be getting it.\n\nI need someone to talk some sense into me not to waste time being petty, being spiteful, to be professional so I don't burn any other bridges (this is a small industry), and to just be better. **How do I save what I have left of my reputation and how should I move forward?**",1aloot0,16,1707371394

109,[SA] Is it better to keep everything in writing rather than verbal?

112,Sudden 'communication issues' at work.,"I started a new position in September. Everything was going amazing, I could tell right away in my interview that the supervisors were my kind of people. The job is amazing, I love everything about it. Except... A few weeks after I started, a new supervisor was promoted. They have never been a supervisor before. In December, I was assigned to directly report to them. Things started getting weird right before Christmas. They sent me an email with some materials to review for a phone meeting we had scheduled for the next Wednesday. The email arrived on Thursday and implied that I was already gone for the weekend and I would be opening this email on Monday. I replied something like 'you caught me before my weekend, I have PTO on Monday and Tuesday but thank you for the prep time.' I immediately got a call from my supervisor above them and I never understood what the beef was but apparently they had looked at the schedule and saw someone with a similar name who was already off for the weekend and thought it was me and that I was being insubordinate(?) with my response. \n\nEver since then things have been really awkward for me at work, I feel like everything they say to me is in a condescending tone. I have been just sloughing it off because I know you can't imply tone in text. Then this week a similar situation happened when I told a coworker how to do something in a public chat and they came in and told him that I was wrong. Again, I got a call from their supervisor who was ready to get on to me for giving incorrect information but then looked at the conversation and saw that I was right. But proceeded to tell me ad nauseum that my first answer should have been clear enough that anyone coming into the conversation would know it's right from the first message. (I said 'some people' where I should have used the word 'managers') I said fair enough and also took the hint that I can just give answers like that privately and they won't be scrutinized. \n\nA little while later, I got a message saying that I was being changed to have a different supervisor. I replied with thanks for letting me know and that I think this will be a positive change as the current supervisor and I seem to have differing communication styles. The reply really took me aback.

122,[NY] False accusations by coworker but HR and manager won’t tell me the details; losing job,"A few months ago a coworker made a false allegation that I harassed her verbally to HR. I was then pulled into an HR meeting where I was questioned about what was said, but I denied any mentioning of verbal harassment and any meanspirited comments. I asked HR for the details of what I was accused of and who else knew but they refused to tell me. Since then I’ve never been given the chance to refute the claims of the coworker, but was just advised to never be alone with them.\n\nMy manager recently told me I’ll be asked to leave the company later this year due to what this coworker said. I’ve had very positive reviews even when being told I have to leave and it was made clear that this allegation is why I am losing my job. This manager also told me that the allegation was initially told to him and he then told the coworker to tell HR and his boss. The manager also refuses to tell me the exact details of the allegation and says he isn’t allowed to tell.\n\nI feel like I am being railroaded here. I’m fine with finding a new job especially with the months of time I have, but I am angry they won’t tell me what I am accused of and won’t share any of the reports generated. What recourse do I have? Can I compel HR to share the nature of the allegation? Why would they decide not to share the accusation with me and not let me provide evidence to refute the claims?

125,A script for when I let things fall through the cracks — on purpose?,"I work as an executive assistant at a luxury property management company, and it’s one of those roles where “EA” is understood to stand for “everyone’s assistant.” I manage processes across our entire team that there really isn’t anyone else available to handle  (such as vendor management, setting up trainings, and so forth) and people are constantly coming to me with requests. My boss, the executive who delegated those tasks to me, has his own management portfolio consisting of two large buildings (in addition to his executive duties) — one of which includes a whopping 600 residential apartments, and both of which I assist with. On top of that, my boss hired another property manager nine months ago to take over a couple of buildings which *had* been in his portfolio, and unfortunately, our CEO hasn’t approved hiring a dedicated assistant for that person yet, so…guess who? (It’s “temporary,” as I have been told, repeatedly. For nine months.)\n\nI basically have three jobs, with multiple managers. I work hard all day and then take work home at night. I go in on Saturdays to catch up on emails. And the pay is awful, so on top of all of this, I’m also cooking my own meals, doing my own shopping, washing my clothes at the laundromat, etc., because I can’t justify spending extra money on takeout or laundry drop-off. I am *burned out,* and I deeply hate property management.\n\nI know what I need to do: immediately stop working 12-hour days and limit my work week to exactly 40 hours, so that I can spend my spare time finding a better job.\n\nThe problem is that I am working long hours to try to keep everything afloat, and most days I’m *still* not getting through everything on my high-priority list, much less having a chance to tackle lower-priority items. There is no one I can delegate anything to (we’re very siloed, and also short-staffed). My boss never has a solution when I approach him about my workload — things were easier back when he was an assistant, and he has no idea how much time everything takes now, and always makes the workload issue about my “time management skills” instead of the sheer unsustainibility of my role. So if I let things fall, I am going to *hear about it.* From him, yes, but also from everyone else in the company. I’m already getting flak from all directions for being slow to handle items on that lower-priority list.\n\nDoes anyone have a good, professional yet pointed way to respond to the kind of flak that results when you draw a boundary like this, and start letting you-know-what hit the fan? I have no doubt that my refusal to keep working long hours is going to be very poorly received, and unfortunately I can’t be cavalier about it — I need a salary and health insurance until I find something new. But I want to make it very clear that I’m done taking work home, and that making sure everything gets done needs to be partly (if not mostly) the responsibility of the management team to make sure we are adequately staffed and supported.\n\nWould love to hear from others who have successfully navigated criticism after “disengaging” (a.k.a. working normally).",1alnncj,1,1707367787

145,Thoughts on Mizuho Americas?,"Hi all, I am leaving my current position and was wondering if anyone had any insight into what it's like to work at Mizuho Americas. Without getting into specifics, this would be for a VP/Director level position in Finance (not Accounting). This would translate to ~20% bump in salary. I have a few questions/concerns:\n\n- What is work/life balance like? Currently working 2 remote/3 in office 9-5:30 except Friday 9-3.\n\n- What is the corporate culture like? Bureaucratic? Collaborative? Everyone is siloed off into their respective realm of expertise, or is there exposure to a lot of interesting things?\n\n- What can I expect for bonus? This is through a recruiter and he's saying 25% - 40% bonus, but I don't know if he's just making up numbers or if that's the norm.\n\n- Career paths: are there clearly defined tracks and a progression path, promotions from within?\n\n- Any insight into their benefits package/401k?\n\nAny other advice would be greatly appreciated.

146,Which should I pursue? Interior designer or social media manager career?,I can’t decide between both. I applied for both masters in interior design and social media marketing. I love both. The good thing about social media marketing is you get to work from home where it’s easy to stay with family and kids and interior design is onsite but I love creating appealing spaces. Since I haven’t worked in both professions before but I want a flexible career not stressful I know stress comes with every career but not the kind of stress that would burn me out. I want to have weekends off don’t want to do any work after work shift at home. So I think social media is better but you manage social accounts and have to work after work hours to post and weekends too right? Tell me your experience if you worked in interior design or social media marketing plz.,1alm9nq,1,1707363335

153,Should I apply for stepping-stone jobs that I don't want and hope to transition later on?

154,Should I quit my job for not receiving a deserved pay increase?,"I am trying to make a tough career decision:\r\n\n* Stay in the current place where I am underpaid.\r\n* Move to a different company for better pay but which has a toxic culture.\r\n* Accept a lower/downgraded role somewhere else for the same pay.\n\n\r\n\nIf you have the time to read and care for some context, here is some background story:\r  \n\r  \nI work as a Project Manager in a big company, coordinating managers from different departments on implementing new clients to our business. I am the only one to hold this role, and although officially I report directly to the COO, it's his two directors I actually report on the projects. This role did not exist in my company before as the two directors would follow the projects themselves but could no longer manage the time.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I got promoted 1.5 years ago, I had the same salary as all junior managers in my company but no bonus (managers get a 30% performance-based bonus on top of the salary). After 1 year in the role, they get a 50% increase in the base salary. The next years after are variable based on performance.\r  \n\r  \nI was promised a bonus and a salary increase as well when I first started but nothing official, so when the company went through some budget cuts, it was postponed. During the 2023 end-of-year performance reviews, the company still continued with the same salary increases for all junior managers in other departments.\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, my boss was not sharing the performance review with me at all. So after waiting 1 more month, I requested the meeting myself. My boss (with whom I've had very little contact) invited his two directors to provide feedback in his place since they have been more involved with my work. The two directors had nothing but good words to say, while my boss said although he only hears good words from others, I have been very passive towards him and not gone to him to show my work and ask what his priorities were. So as far as he knows, I have not been working hard enough. As a result, I did not get a pay increase, and after an intervention from one of the directors, he agreed only on a 20% performance-based bonus.\r  \n\r  \nHere is my dilemma: I have been here for 8 years and love the work culture + i respect most of the other people in the company except for my boss, who is not involved at all in my work and growth, while I know he is very engaged with the two directors. The role has provided me with the opportunity to increase my skills and i have 2 big projects comming up that i can learn a lot more from. But considering I have more responsibilities but only get paid half of other managers + the fact that my boss is not investing in my professional growth is very demotivating.\r  \n\r  \nI did find some openings that pay a bit better, but I have negative feedback from people working there on toxic work culture. There are also some opportunities for the same pay in other companies but comming with considerable demotion in role (not easier job, but demotion nonetheless). Worth mentioning that the company i work is known accross the whole region on having the best work culture, this being its main selling point.\r  \n\r  \nI haven't had the chance to sort through my emotions and thoughts clearly yet, but before making a decision, I would like to gather as many points of view as possible.

My official title in my employee portal is “Engineer II”. Titles for engineer-type roles in our company follow the pattern Engineer I > Engineer II > Senior Engineer I > Senior Engineer II > Principal Engineer. The rates that we provide for clients only fall under 3 categories – Engineer, Senior Engineer, and Principal Engineer with each higher rate being about 10% more than the previous rate. I have access to the proposals that my boss provides to clients, and he is charging my services at the “Senior Engineer” rate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\r  \nHere’s the catch – I was hired under an “aerospace engineer” role, which is what it says on my offer letter and I have asked him why is my title Engineer II rather than Senior, since my experience seems to align more closely with the Senior level and his response was that since I was hired under the “aerospace engineer” title, that the closest engineer title in the system is “Engineer II”. However, I also know that our team has recently hired another person who is much older than me under the same job description and title and his title is “principal engineer”.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\r  \nSo, my question is, what do I do about this?

I’ve worked as an intern at another company previously, who I believe would extend a full-time offer, but my current job aligns much better with my career goals.\n\n  \nMy boss messaged me asking to talk today and they basically told me I have been doing a really good  job. They asked if I was interested in working part-time when I return to school, to which I agreed since I could use some extra money.\n\n  \nThen, they told me they’re going to pay me more. They said if I commit now to working part-time and then transitioning into a full-time role (post-graduation), I will get an even larger raise. Specific numbers were not discussed yet, but once I determine how many hours I can commit to part-time, I'll ask for more details.\n\n  \nThe offer caught me off guard, but I am definitely interested in working with the company full-time.

We were a team of four, everyone had their own responsibility and tasks. Two employees quit without a warning and I believe it scared my boss because we were struggling with only two of us left. He hired a 'consultant' who promised to make big changes but the only thing he added was more employees (four additional employees)\nWe are a team of 6 now.... Everyone's responsibilities got cut in half. We are so over-staffed that numerous employees do the same task together which only takes one person, they take multiple breaks because there isn't much to do. We cut off hours but like I said, everyone has micro-tasks and most of the time there isn't much to do for them.\n\nI talked to my boss, he sees the extra staff schmoozing around in the kitchen, I ran out of tasks to give them.\n\nThe problem is that sales slightly decreased when we were under-staffed. Now my boss shows me his bank account, how he's barely profiting weekly, and says there are too many people on the payroll. Nothing changed, it's been like this for a few weeks.\n\nHe seems to completely agree with the 'consultant' he brought in, but prior to this we all managed very well with a team of four.\n\nEverytime it's payroll my boss says the same time. And when I deposit my check, he reminds me of it the next morning.\n\nI loved my job, but I'm not working nor managing anymore, it feels more 'babysitting'\n\nWe are a small cafe and we've been receiving same complaints how there are 5 staff behind the counter and only one is working... Of course, because they all have one task (which wasn't like before).\n\nWe have a sandwich Maker, barista, pizza guy, kitchen prep, cleaner, and I. \n\nThe cleaner and kitchen prep do everything together. The barista stands all day waiting. Everything is prepped for the week and there isn't much left. So they find other things to help with 'slowly'\n\nI wanted to train the other guys on these stations so they're more useful but it doesn't seem like my boss agrees. \n\nI've stopped managing the employees, it pisses me off watching them walking around, watching YouTube, take hour breaks and when I review their day, nothing gets done daily.\n\nI wanted to cut more hours for the employees but the consultant gave everyone the same schedule. For example everyone works 7am-6pm. We close at 5, the last hour everyone helps each other 'clean' which is the way he wanted it to be setup.\n\nI loved this job and my boss.

It's never been a concern of start time at the various teams I've been on in this company (they're generally very flexible and it's somewhat informally understood about later start times because you could be up late at night). Some implementation teams routinely start as late as 10:30 AM. \n\nHe even wrote some bullshit that our standard hours are 8:30-5:30, which is complete horse shit because no one on our team logs on before 9. \n\nI got a negative rating for culture/team rating saying I didn't work with my team/train direct reports. I talk everyday with my team members for testing new functionality and any potentialbugs/defects we come across, despite the fact we are all on different clients.

175,What should I do?," \nHi, I’m graduating in May with my degree in health science. All through undergrad I’ve been wanting to pursue optometry. I’ve applied to schools and have been waitlisted but I’ve been thinking if I actually want to pursue this career. I have worked as an optometric tech for 2 years in 2 settings. While I am a tech in my current job I also work as a receptionist when there isn’t enough staff. I’ve been thinking about pursuing either a MHA or MPH. But the thing is I don’t know if I should enroll into a program after I graduate (idk if it’s too late to apply since I recently started thinking about this). Or if I should get a job out of college and build my resume/gain experience and then pursue my masters. If I do look for a job I don’t know where to start the only things that I come across is clinical research coordinator. Any advice would be helpful, I appreciate it a lot.",1alypzw,1,1707407340
176,What should I do here?,So I'm lost\n\nI have tried to get a job that I can stick with for about a year. I am 18 a year out of high school. I got 2 jobs but couldn't keep because of management. So now I have been stuck trying to get a job in a competitive market in a small town. I don't know what I can do. And I just learned I have an anxiety disorder so theres that. My mom is still working keeping everything paid for and my dad passed away so it's just me and my mom. Thing is she can't make good financial decisions so it's a little rough. I'd like to get my own income but can't keep a job and I have an anxiety disorder but can't afford therapy so I need some advice here.,1alyn7x,1,1707407139

I’ve gotten more combative with the other departments because although I’m following our process they don’t care and want me to do thing their way.

It’s just the same stuff week after week.\n\nIn past conversations - not about me but just general - my manager talked about how you just need to “dodge the bullshit” and keep going. I’ve tried to keep that in mind these couple months but honestly I’m just drained now. I’m constantly fighting and haven’t gotten anywhere. It’s been hard lately to put on that cheery smile.

184,Help with Promotional Panel mental impasse please?,"Promotional panel impasse\n\nHi, I work for a UK Engineering company, and have for about 22 years.\n\nI have decided to remain within the Engineering staff population as the idea of transition into management has never appealed. \n\nI can go up one further rung within the Engineering population and have been encouraged to do so by the line manager and peers. \n\nThe process is to prepare a written submission,  case studies, presentations and so on, then present in front of a panel of my choosing. Thre are plenty of good people I could select and who would be happy to form a panel.\n\nSo far, so easy, right? Except I just can't. I just can't bring myself to do it. I've started the pack, multiple times, then descending into a pit of gloom and deleting it all. I hate the procedure so thoroughly.  I feel dirty, angry and upset as soon as I start to do anything towards it.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that I am working at or above that level, but it can't be given apart from through this process.  Other, less experienced and less capable people seem to breeze through it. I think my level of introspection is preventing me from getting any further with it. I've seen people prepare a pack and sit a panel within a few weeks. Every time I try, I get depressed and shelve the idea for another 6 months.\n\nI am now getting regularly overtaken by people that I supervise, yet I can't bring myself to take this step personally.  My day to day job would be largely unaltered, I just have to go through this panel, there's no way round it.  I know the limitations come from within: in terms of job skills I've been easy capable for more than 10 years which is widely known. \n\nLiterally this could be the last promotion I'd ever have to do unless I have some sort of management epiphany which is 99% unlikely. \n\nI do wonder if this is what a ceiling feels like. Some people just get to a level they can't exceed, not because of a lack of skills, but by not wanting to do the self-aggrandising promotional packs.\n\nThen I get into a philosophical debate with myself. Why should I want this? What is it that is supposed to make me want to progress upwards? Its not fair, but then, life isn't fair. Somebody has to be on the losing side. I'm not in direct competition with anybody. \n\nI'm almost in tears writing this and i don't understand why.\n\nI need a walk round the block to simmer down now!!\n\nThoughts appreciated!!

One career I am interested in is the Distribution/Sales side of AM, and I am considering if I should do an internship to explore if its for me.\n\nAs I am graduating, should I just focus my efforts on IB/PE for FT recruitment instead?

192,Should I Quit My Master's Program?,"I am in my first semester of my clinical mental health counseling masters program and I have been hating it. I'm taking a skills class and we have been doing mock counseling sessions, but it is not how I thought it would be. We are not allowed to give advice, we are taught that we are only allowed to listen and give minimal encouragers/paraphrase to get the client to keep talking and to figure out their own way. I would walk out of a counseling session if someone just repeated everything I said. I thought this career was about helping people and being able to learn the skills to give them the coping skills and to help them see what they cannot. I understand that some people are not able to recognize how they feel, but we are not even allowed to ask them about their feelings. There are so many rules and this is just not what I thought it was. I am 34 years old and it has taken me so long to find a career path that I was passionate about and this is just so discouraging. I guess I just need advice. Has anyone gone through this? Is there another career path that could be better for me? I need something active, helpful, and that does not limit me.

196,Is my job stealing my pay?,"Hey, I'm not sure if anyone can actually help me figure this out but I have a problem at my job. For some context I work at a medium-sized sized family owned warehousing company. I've been in my position for a bit over a year now and have work at this company in the past but in a different role. My current position it technically commission based, my self and 5 coworkers earn 25% of the total pay the company receives for freight being shipped out from one of our warehouses or that is picked up from 3rd party brokers. We also earn small randomly assigned dollar amounts for extra work that we do on and off property. My issue is that my employer refuses to tell any of us how much we are making prior to us doing any work and if we ask what dollar amount we are making on specific loads we are sometimes given an arbitrary number and other times turned away with a simple I don't know. I've expressed my dismay with this to everyone including the owner and have been told 'We do not have to tell you how much the total load is worth.' Another issue that goes hand in hand with that is each load changes pay on a case by case basis due to market influx which makes it difficult for us 6 to predict our daily and weekly pay. My weekly pay stub only has the dollar amount that is assigned to us but nothing more. No two paychecks are ever the same and have changed drastically week to week. I believe my job is stealing our wages and giving us an any dollar amount they see fit because we don't have any legitimate proof to argue against them. I've also been unsuccessful on finding articles or legal codes on an employer being required to disclose your pay.

There are 7 CSRs and we are apparently missing 4 CSRs as in the last 6 months they fired 3 and 2 resigned. They are about to move our department to a bad area of town and some people quit because of it. Even with 4-5 more people, I’m still not sure there would be enough staff.\n\nI have been there about ten months. I am doing well but I guess not keeping up, it is hard to keep up with the volume. I am expected to enter orders and respond to emails. The company has a lot of dysfunctional processes. CSRs left and got fired, the department got rearranged, and I got assigned more accounts and responsibilities in a different industry business unit.\n\nWe are supposed to enter all new orders within 24 hours, and also respond to all emails within 24 hours. About half or more of orders have issues that need follow up on. Management does go into our orders and track how long it took them to be entered into the system, but nothing else. Every customer thinks their order or request is extremely urgent (they are but everyone’s request is urgent).\n\nI am highly detailed and organized but struggle to keep up. Sometimes I’ll only entered a few orders a day and send 50 emails, but management and higher ups only care about how many and how fast you enter orders. \n\nI do feel like I organize myself well but there isn’t enough time in the day to get all orders in and emails responded to. I guess I am not prioritizing new orders enough and tend to emails more with order changes, questions, etc.\n\nI’ve always been a top performer at other companies but I guess not here. I think the work I do is good, but not fast enough. \n\nMy manager suggested I not dig into issues much and pass them off to other departments and prioritize new order entry.\n\nI am looking for a new job, because I do not like this company, but also want to work in my workplace habits.\n\nI’ve noticed those who are prioritizing new order entry are neglecting other things like doing order changes and notifying customers of delays or not responding to emails. It almost seems like the unspoken rule is to enter orders at all costs and ignore actual work that needs to be done with existing orders. And not follow processes. Example, the person who enters the most orders daily ignores her daily reports for orders move outs and production delays, and also doesn’t hold up an order if it has a price discrepancy like we are supposed to, and I’ve had a customer or two call in saying she won’t respond to their email, so I would tell the customer to forward it to me so I could handle.\n\nOr, I’m just slow AF and can’t keep up. I know I’ve heard a coworker say, when barraged about not entering orders fast enough, “I guess I just won’t answer emails then.” And also, a coworker whispered to me that she had 600 unread emails, as she just pulls out orders and ignored the rest.",1aljru3,1,1707355984

I was mainly responsible for developing training solutions for end users. That job was low stress and not that technical but I found it very fulfilling and aligned with my work values. I stayed in that position for 4 years before switching to a more technical role as a solutions architect in the same software company. Right off the bat, I started feeling uncomfortable in the technical role, and within a year my project had ended. I ultimately decided to switch out of consulting to look for a more 'stable' role at a manufacturing company as an IT analyst. \r  \n\r  \nI have been at my current job for the last 10 months working as an IT analyst, but I am finding the job to be dreadful and difficult because it ended up being more technical than I wanted it to be.\r I am now feeling very lost and confused because I am in an IT role which is not my area of expertise, I am working with software and solutions that I am not entirely familiar with, and it's not something that I wanted to do. \n\n\r\rThis has caused me a lot of unhappiness, and I find myself staying up at night dreading about work the next day.

204,Is the financial industry more stable than tech?,"Considering all the layoffs in the tech industry (not even just in the US). There are many reasons for this. It is also very difficult to get entry jobs as well. I have 2 years experience in IT support (in CRE) and Software Engineering. Also there is a trend for companies to hire cheaper Devs from India and Eastern Europe. But I am considering probably looking more into finance if it is more stable. Looking at the entry requirements it actually seems a lot easier (a lot less technical knowledge required). Also, I am not super duper passionate about tech (it can be nice but it's just a job for me) However, I am open for roles such as Data Analysts where technical knowledge such as Python and SQL is still being used.

211,Private or Public: Which opportunity to pursue?,"I am a fresh graduate with Latin honors (cum laude), with 6 months of part-time job experience as a pharmacy assistant during and after my internship.\r  \n\r  \nI recently passed my board exam just this November and I aimed to apply right away for an entry-level plantilla position (Pharmacist II) at a government hospital. However, there were only 4 open positions available. In line with my application, I passed their first screening, qualifying exams, and actual performance evaluation, which took me 4 months to complete until I reached their final stage of screening. Initially, there were a total of 21 applicants who took the exams, but it was narrowed down to 14 of us who underwent performance evaluation. Now, the remaining 14 applicants, including myself, are about to undergo the interview, which is the last step of their recruitment process before receiving a job offer.\r  \n\r  \nDue to my doubts about my chances of getting into government service due to factors such as being a fresh graduate, limited years of experience, and lack of connections, I sought a backup plan by applying to a private hospital (Level II) in the same location. It's one of the leading private hospitals in the city, and I got accepted after passing their exams and interviews. However, there's a catch: in order to be finally hired, I have to undergo a 2-week training with no pay (only provided with free lunch and transportation allowance), then I will work as a probationary employee for 6 months (earning around ₱14k-₱15k monthly), and after another 6 months, I may be regularized with a potential salary increase (up to <₱18k). Additionally, after passing the 2-week training, I would have to sign a minimum 24-month contract, and there would be a fine if I break it. However, they promised comprehensive training to enhance my skills in various areas and assured that they would cover all expenses for convention training or CPD training.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem is that my training in the private sector and interview in the public sector fall in the same week. Let's say, the training starts on Feb 19, and the interview at the government hospital is scheduled for Feb 21.\r  \n\r  \nQuestions:\r  \n\r  \n1.\tIf you were in my situation, how would you strategically and realistically approach it?\r  \n2.\tIs it acceptable to accept the 24-month contract knowing that there is potential for professional growth with the private hospital, or should I continue to hope for an opportunity at the government hospital instead?\r  \n3.\tWhat is the probability or likelihood that a government agency will accept fresh graduates and recently board-passed individuals? (Some of my fellow applicants have over 3 years of experience in the field, and one of them was even my professor before. Also, some of them are fresh graduates like me)\r  \n4.\tSuppose I still wanted to attend the interview at the government hospital just to gain experience and insight into what to expect if given the chance to reapply again. What would be a suitable excuse to give to the private sector to be excused from training on that day?\r  \n5.\tAssuming the universe favors me greatly this year and I am lucky enough to be selected from the 4 positions the government agency is offering, how would I handle this situation, knowing that I am still undergoing training in the private sector?\r  \n6.\tConsidering realistic possibilities, what is the best course of action given the factors at play in this situation?\r  \n\r  \nThank you so much!

234,How to avoid a big (-60%) salary cut when moving from [GER] to [PL] while keeping the same position?,"Dear HR people:)\r  \n\r  \nA brief background: I am Polish but have been working in Germany since 2018. My transition to Germany was facilitated by my company, which hired me specifically for work in this new location. Now, due to family reasons, I am contemplating a move back to home.  \n\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in my company's response to this desire to relocate. While they are supportive of my decision, they are proposing a significant salary reduction – by as much as 60%. Their rationale is that the cost of living in Poland is considerably lower, thus justifying such a drastic cut. However, this reasoning seems flawed to me. While it's true that certain aspects of living costs may be lower in Poland, the overall difference is nowhere near 60%. When I compare the purchasing power of an average salary in Germany versus Poland, the gap is closer to 30%, with Germany often offering more value for essentials like fuel. Have a look here: [https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare\\_countries\\_result.jsp?country1=Germany&country2=Poland](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Germany&country2=Poland) If you want to get a better overview compare how much of anything you can buy for a average salary in Germany compared to the same in Poland:(\r  \n\r  \nNow, my dilemma is how best to approach the discussion with HR to negotiate a salary that reflects the true value of my position, responsibilities, and expertise. It's worth noting that I work for a large international company, and my role doesn't have an equivalent counterpart in Country A. Additionally, my workload and responsibilities will remain unchanged, especially considering the shift to remote work brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Time zone differences are also a non-issue.\r  \n\r  \nMy perspective is that since the company has allocated a certain budget (X€) for my position, why should the location dictate such a drastic adjustment? From a long-term perspective, maintaining my salary at a comparable level seems reasonable and fair. However, I need compelling arguments to present during negotiations to avoid this significant salary cut. I am deeply committed to my job, having dedicated 15 years to this field, and I believe my expertise adds considerable value to the company. Moreover, given the niche nature of my industry, opportunities outside of my current role are somewhat limited.\r  \n\r  \nIn essence, how can I effectively communicate to HR the importance of maintaining my salary at a level commensurate with my contributions and the market value of my skills, despite the proposed relocation? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1aleihg,0,1707342085

My billing rate is $200/hr. 2000 hours a year (not including any OT) brings me to $400K minimum for my yearly income if I were to successfully negotiate an identical rate as an independent consultant. Sure, there’s higher taxes, private health insurance, additional liability insurance, no retirement benefits etc., but it’s a $200-$250K jump that should allow me to pay for all of that and still save/invest a lot more.

At this point in the game, it would not be beneficial to hire new people just to shut those things down. The new company doesn't have policies against working multiple jobs in the handbook and my potential new manager states that the work is distinct enough that he doesn't view it as a conflict of interests as long as I'm not double dipping on time.

Next was funneled through a recruiter (who also sits on the board) and sent a personality test (an excel file lol). Found out later that she gets a 20% recruitment fee for that sham. My interview with the manager was odd. He didn’t have many questions and let a 26 year old accountant lead the interview. I ended up getting the job. I have been trying to get into data or software engineering for awhile and was excited for anything related.

I was given some data analysis work to do with almost zero guidance, expectations, support or feedback. After 4 weeks they let me go because they decided the MRP system would take longer to implement than expected. When pressed they also said the data I presented had some errors.

259,How do I end things with a client after just two months?,"I could use some advice on ending things with a client after two months.\n\nI’ve been working with a new marketing agency client for 2 months now and it really hasn’t turned out well. I’ve been freelancing as a copywriter for two years but this has been a low for me.  \n\nWhile I do enjoy freelancing, I’ve been looking for some full time, in-house roles. Last September I applied for a full time copywriter position with a marketing agency and I got quite far down the application process before they went silent for 2 months. They came back to me and said there had been some internal changes which eliminated the role but they offered me freelance work on a month long ‘rolling contract’ which would ‘definitely turn into full time’. I thought I would be able to juggle the apparently small amount of work for them around my other clients.\n\n2 months in and this is not a freelance copywriter role at all, it’s much more of a account executive role. I’m attending all their internal meetings, managing their current clients and pitching to new clients for them with a small amount of social copywriting, but on a very low day rate and with no job security or any other perks as I’m on a month-long rolling contract. I’m using my own laptop and still haven’t had any formal training on their systems. Despite all this, they are good people and we have had some discussions about long term projects indicating they think I’ll be around for a while.\n\nBut, the job doesn’t play to my strengths in any way and they have pulled me up on one or two\nissues already.\n\nThis has also started to impact my other clients. The first week I worked 5 days a week for this company, 8 hours a day. This forced me to have to do my other work at night and on the weekend which really isn’t the point of being a freelancer. I did have a conversation with them where I pointed out that we needed to agree on some clear set days which did help manage their expectations a bit.\n\nI’ve now been approached (completely unprompted) by one of my other long term freelance clients with an actual full time job offer and it’s pretty much a dream role that I can’t turn down. I get on well with them and they’re in an industry that’s really exciting.\n\nI’d hate to completely burn the bridge with the marketing agency but I can’t see any other way around it. They’re already short-staffed as a few people have left recently so me leaving really will put them in a difficult position. I do have a big network of other freelance copywriters who have some experience of managing accounts so I could recommend someone if that would help.\n\nI’ve never had to end things with a client on my terms.

272,Help trying to return to work after long unemployment gap with physical limitations,"I was wondering if anyone might have any advice for my situation. I am 44 (going on 45 in two weeks) and I have been unemployed for 15 years. I was forced to leave the job market back then because of medical reasons. At the time, I was advised by my doctor to apply for disability because I wasn't really able to do half of what my current job required. The whole process took more than two years before my final appeal for disability was denied. I tried to go back to work a couple of times since then but admittedly didn't put much energy into it as my weight combined with my other medical concerns prevented me from qualifying from any job that I was both qualified for and physically capable of performing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now. The family member who has been caring for me is retiring this year and the need for me to look towards my own eventual needs once they are gone has been weighing on me more and more. Additionally, I have been steadily if slowly losing weight the past two years which has left me feeling more energetic and capable of working again. I am faced with a few incredibly steep hurdles, however. I have an associates degree in Computer Information Systems that isn't worth the paper it's printed on. My relevant work experience is solely in customer service and vessel agency (also referred to as ship operation). Customer service has changed dramatically in 15 years for numerous reasons and call centers are slightly more scarce where I live than they used to be. Vessel agency as an industry has also changed dramatically and shrunken somewhat and I am still not physically capable of performing some of the tasks potentially required. I am not physically capable of working a job that would require me to work on my feet for a full shift. My head would grow fuzzy and I might literally pass out after an hour. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, with such a massive gap in my work history and such narrow and possibly no longer relative work experience.... what do I need to do to get a job? I've been applying to every customer service job I can find in my area but so far I've only earned one interview. It went very well but not even a day later I got an email saying they weren't moving forward with me. How do I overcome that massive employment gap and my physical limitations?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd no, applying for disability again isn't a solution. They recently changed the disability laws and it is becoming even harder to qualify disability. You literally need to be physically and mentally unable to do ANY job or practically at retirement age to qualify for disability now. It doesn't matter that no one will hire me because of my limitations if I am still able to do the job. Still won't qualify. Great system we have, isn't it?",1alsakk,3,1707386299

The work on itself was very demanding which isn't usually a problem for me but In this case I was actually worried about breaking my back. We were transporting lots of construction power distributors and gigantic amounts of power cables, I was exhausted after two days.\n\nAnyways what bortherd me the most was that the company didn't hold their words and were lying to each other nonstop. As for example, there was this cofounder who literally lifed in the storage room in a container during the week and I was told during my interview that I would take workloads of of him to make his life a little easier. They gave him even more workload just because I was there to help, it seems. \n\nOn my last day they made some burgers supposingly just obligatory but when I asked the coworker, who was the guy living in the container, he told me it wasn't just out of good will but they were rather celebrating a new employee. They gaslighted me afterwards and put me under pressure by claiming they had another competitioner trying for this job and he took ages to make a decision. I immediately called him out and told him even if they weren't talking about me, I still felt as if they meant me.\n\nNot to mention the others who always left earlier because they have been so overworked and unhappy with this place that they wouldn't sacrifice an extra minute there, supposedly where still working when I asked my employer about it. Lie after lie. I feel sorry for the guy learning electronics without even having a master to teach him. The guy closest to a master was a learned deep builder.\n\nAnd now today a whole week later I got a contract which includes traveling around the whole country and a phone call from said employer hoping to get me under contract but I said no. I don't understand why I feel guilty about probably because he sounded so sad about it all. It really felt like rejection, I have never been in such a position before and I desperately needed the job but I just can't sacrifice myself like that. I told him it was just to far away for me after a akward phone call with my battery dying.\n\nWhy is it so hard to amke a decision as an adult amd why do I feel like I'm runnig away from my own happiness.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTldr: terrible workplace offers me a job and I feel guilty for declining later on.",1alylr1,1,1707407036

279,negotiating my salary,"so I recently got offered a manager position. I always get flustered on the salary negotiation part and usually just agree on what they offer me. This time though I made a lot more as a PRN (I’m an RN) and wanted to make at least the same as what I was making.\nSo here’s what happened, hiring manager asked me what I was looking for, I got nervous and low balled myself meanwhile she sounded happy. She called me back and gave me 5k more of what I said. I told her I will take it but then I thought about it and realized I really don’t want to take a pay cut for more responsibility and working more hours. Also I realized that the other manager is leaving and I will be the only one until they found another manager (in my experience it took so long for them to start hiring people so I don’t even know when they will hire another one). Also I think I have to mention that I waited 2 weeks from the time I agreed to the time I realized I want to negotiate my salary again (because of some personal issues) so she wasn’t happy about that either. last time we spoke she said they don’t want to give me what I was asking and basically told me that they gave me the highest they can for my experience (which isn’t true because I have more experience than the other manager who is leaving and they gave her more money, although she does have masters and I don’t). I think I am over thinking it. Was it wrong that I tried to renegotiate my salary after verbally accepting the position?",1al9umk,2,1707330468

281,Leaving Teaching - Will I be Alright?,"27 year old man from east coast USA. Bachelors in sociology and masters in education from highly respected colleges in my state. Always knew teaching by wasn’t for me, I only did it because I enjoyed being around like-minded, friendly people and knowing exactly what the benefits of the job would be.\n\nI am currently a sub teacher (I really did not want to be) because I left the last sixth grade position I was at (school was really terrible.) this year, I find myself completely unable to keep going. Getting cursed at every day, bosses that eyeball and follow you around and make you work extra hard for no extra money since they know I have teaching experience. I’ve had several kids at the school I’m at threaten to hit me or basically just verbally abuse me when I try to redirect them. I physically just can’t do it anymore - waking up a 3am every morning dreading going to work and getting punished for $150 a day. This job and career sucks.\n\nI am smart, hard working and a very fast learner. I like teaching and learning and have been applying to colleges around me for advisor/professor asst jobs but haven’t heard anything in 10+ days and it’s really draining me. I like to work with groups of people and honestly, I don’t mind teaching and book work! Working with children nowadays is just very unrewarding and their behaviors will absolutely kill you in no time.\n\nDo you think I can find something better? I have lots of good work experience, tons of experienced and respectable references and have never been in trouble in or out of work. Unfortunately, I am prepared to leave this current job on a bad note because of how I get treated and overworked, like I am really prepared to just stop showing up; something I’ve never once done at a job before.

289,[NY] Need help - any opinions on TribalBase and ShortlistIQ???,"I'm currently exploring options that could make my job a little bit easier and have come across two interesting platforms: TribalBase and ShortlistIQ. However, these apps have different purposes, I mean, they are used for two completely different things, so I would use them both in any case, but I would like to hear your experience/opinion if you have used them.\n\nFrom what I've gathered so far, if you ever liked using Slack then you'll be interested in trying out [TribalBase](https://tribalbase.ai/), but what caught my attention is that the database is indexed and searchable, basically, it’s a Google for Slack. Here's an example I found online when I was digging for some info about these apps: 'You might vaguely remember Dina from recruitment talking about sending onboarding guides to new hires. Just ask the TribalBase bot: Did we send onboarding guides to new hires? You’ll get an answer right away!' Pretty awesome I must admit.\n\nAnd when it comes to [ShortlistIQ](https://www.shortlistiq.com/),  when I heard about AI Assistant I was so into that! It offers features for streamlining recruitment processes, managing candidate data, and improving overall HR efficiency. I love the fact that your AI interviewer can be quickly trained to ask in-depth, job-specific questions that drill down to the candidate’s true capabilities. That would save a lot of time!\n\nI know that both of these apps sound pretty cool, but I'm curious to know which one stands out in terms of user-friendliness, customization options, and any other factors you think are important.\n\nIf you've used TribalBase or ShortlistIQ in your company or for your personal needs, please share your thoughts. What are the pros and cons of each platform? Did you encounter any challenges during implementation or daily usage?\n\nThanks guys, have a nice day!",1al0d40,5,1707303507

316,There's no other way to put it.. Job interviews are fucking stupid,"I'm currently sitting in front of my tablet and recording answers for an online job interview... The one where they send you the stupid generic questions and you have to record answers for these stupid generic questions. The fact that these stupid ass questions get asked reveals that they want a specific type of answer and, regardless of your work history, if you don't get an answer that seems good enough for the one person on the talent acquisition team, you won't get the job. Research has literally shown that job interviews are not good indicators of the quality of work a candidate will bring to your business or organization. We as humans do a piss poor job and assessing others in short periods of time and with most job interviews being less than 45 minutes... What are they useful for?\n\nI'm sitting in front of a screen where a job interview question is asking me to describe a time where I was disappointed in results and what I could have done better... Like what the fuck. I literally can't think of anything because the honest truth is just that I'm a hardworking fucking employee who tends to go above and beyond, despite the fact that My hard work is never really appreciated at any fucking place I've ever worked. Every time I do a job interview all I think about is how I need to become self-employed. These jobs are stupid and the means by which we acquire these jobs through interviews, either in person or recorded interviews... It's all just fucking dumb. I literally don't even know how to make up a lie to answer this stupid question because the question is simply stupid and just fucking useless. I'm a hard-working individual who is literally willing to exchange labor for profit. Hire me.\n\nI think most of these jobs just don't want to admit the reality which is.. The overwhelming majority of people who apply to these positions could probably do these jobs. And if that isn't the case, why do I always hear so many people bitching about how lazy their employed co-workers are. The fact that so many of us have shitty co-workers that are literally working alongside us, allegedly to do the same quality of work but getting away with doing significantly less reveals just how fucking useless job interviews are. Our lazy coworkers are a testament to the fact that a job interview cannot show you the quality of employee a candidate will be.\n\nThis shit is literally giving me a headache.

335,Should I switch from a stable income job to a commission based job?,"Seriously need some advice. F22, preschool teacher. Started my full time job 2 years ago. USD 3000 per month. I have skipped a few grades as a kid, so I have a diploma in early childhood education, and degree in counselling at my age.\n\nWhat is important for me in a job:\n\n1. Well-paid (higher than USD7500 per month)\n2. Work-life balance (for my future kids)\n3. Something I have interest in\n4. Something I am good at\n5. Good reputation (meaning no financial advisor, or jobs that people shun from, because people usually avoid meeting friends who are financial advisors for the fear that they will try to turn a social meeting to a business meeting)\n\nI like the sense of satisfaction I get from my job, but it's so tiring having to deal with children with special needs for a meagre salary. I know I am getting a higher pay as compared to the market rate in the industry (US 2300), but it doesn't feel enough with the work I do, and the stress I go through.\n\nProbably also because I know some people who tick 4 or even all of the requirements in my above list. They are well paid, doing what they are interested in, with a work-life balance. It made me feel that if they can do it, why can't I?\n\nIdeally, I would want to work as a real estate agent. Friends in real estate have ticked all 5 of the above. Their working hours are quite similar to mine, weekday afternoons even. Their weekends are not packed. \n\nConsiderations that are stopping me:\n1. Real estate is commission based. One comment I have been getting at my job is 'You look very young' even when I try to dress maturely to look the part. I am afraid that clients will take one look at me, and not want to engage me as they have no faith in a 'kid'. I am still paying for my house with my partner (prices are crazy expensive) which amounts to USD 750 per month on my end. Not having a steady income is scary as I am afraid that I cannot pay for my house. We also want to have a child in 2 years time, so having the security of a steady income is important. I don't want to push back the plan to have kids. I will need to pay till I am 26 (2028).\n\n2. I considered switching to counselling before I go into real estate in 2028 as I have a degree in counselling, and it is something I have interest in, with about the same pay as my current job, but more work life balance, shorter working hours, and more PTO (paid time off). However, I am at my 3rd job since working full-time for the past 2 years. I don't want to have the reputation as someone who keeps changing jobs. Not a good impression for employers, and my family. \n\n\nBefore you ask:\n1. I know 24 (in 2026) is young to have kids, and you may think I am rushing, but my husband is 5 years older than me. We have been together since I was 18, and we are in a healthy relationship. He earns about USD 4200 per month\n\n2. Left my first job in 2 months due to management. The turnover rate was so high. It got so bad that the government had to step in. They also ruled that the employer was at fault. Left my 2nd job after a year, as I was doing the job of 3 teachers, with a pay that was lower than the market rate, and a toxic boss who gaslights me. I have been working for 7 months now at my 3rd workplace. Across all my workplaces, I have been a high performer, scoring awards, training new staff, and got promoted to senior teacher at my 2nd job due to how well I did my job. I would always work overtime unpaid to do my job to the best of my ability, and always earned praises from higher ups. So no, I was not a low performer. But I am afraid that on the outside, it may seem like I am quitting my job because I give up easily. Asian family things, afraid of what they would think of me. When I revealed that I was changing to my 3rd job, most of them said, 'Huh? Again?' I feel like I am giving them the impression that I am someone with no grit and gives up easily. So I am afraid that if I switch to counselling now (temp job till 2028), the impression will be worse.\n\nSo I guess my dilemma is if I should:\n1. Stay in my stable yet mentally draining preschool teacher job. Everyone will approve as my pay is higher than the market rate, and I am good at my job, and I am interested in it. \n\n2. Switch to be a counsellor till my finances settle in 2028. About the same pay but with better work life balance and PTO. I have interest in counselling. May not be a good impression on future employers, and most importantly, my Asian family for changing jobs too many times (may view me as someone who gives up easily)\n\n3. Switch to be a real estate agent now. High commission, may even earn USD 7000 or more per month. But commission based. I believe I can speak well, but first impressions matter. I have what they call a baby face, and people usually think I am still in middle school. So I am afraid that there will be a lack of trust during the transaction, which may cost my commission. I may have to risk not being able to pay the mortgage for my house for some months, which is scary. OR it could be good for me and my earnings per month will be high. Can go either way. But I am honestly not interested in real estate. I prefer to do things that can make a real impact on people and help them. So I am only considering this job for the money.",1als4ca,1,1707385544

338,Is 100k too much to start a negotiation?,"A little background for you guys - I [26M] am a software engineer with no degree or certificates under my belt. I have been teaching myself the fundamentals of software engineering since a freshman in highschool, and have been in the IT field since I turned 22. I worked a year as a helpdesk technician for an IT company, and then in that same company, I was promoted to be a level 3/dev ops/RADT position. I was in this position for about a year (I developed multiple scripts and macros to help automate a lot of the tedious office tasks in addition to my normal job) before one guy left, moved to a new job, and a couple months later I got a message from him saying that his company was looking for software engineers and I should apply. I applied and got the job, but I didn't really know what I was getting myself into.\n\nI now am a software engineer for a steel casting foundry. When I first started, there was another programmer above me who was starting to show me how the system works, but he quit after me being there for 3 months leaving me to have to reverse engineer everything to learn the system. I am the only software engineer here now, and have been for the last 2.5 years, so I am responsible for the entire system they have here. I manage 2-3 huge projects, and an additional 5-6 smaller ones. I also am in charge of data collection within 3 database servers totaling ~50 schemas (thousands of tables). \n\nWe are in the middle of a software conversion (we are switching ERP platforms) which is going to force me to re-write a lot of our projects functionality. I am going to be the only one who knows how the new system works, and how to fix any issues that might arise. I figured I'd be able to use this as a bargaining chip to get what I want out of a career.\n\nI feel a bit underpaid (currently making 65k) for what i do compared to other software engineers that have to support an entire system by themselves (i could be wrong?). Most of my days in the office are a waste, but my boss does not see the benefits of remote work. He doesn't like working from home, so he forces everyone to stay on his schedule and what he prefers. I don't want to live in the area of this job, but I do enjoy working for this company. So I want to negotiate some terms of me sticking to the company:\n\nFor a 10 year contract, I want:\n\n1.) Hybrid position - 3 remote days, 2 office days\n\n2.) Better pay - I know 100k might not be realistic for my area, but if I'm going to negotiate I should start high right?\n\nI need some opinions on what to do here. I have never been the type to push for what I want out of a company. Any advice is appreciated!!\n\n-*-*-\n\nEdit:\n\nThe only reason I would sign a 10 year contract is because I feel that since this company is always finding ways to cut costs, they wouldn't bite on my negotiation if I wasn't guaranteed x amount of years. I am also in a very low cost of living area, but do not want to continue living in the area. I just don't know if this company will pay me a wage for what area I decide to live in, along with even allowing me to work a hybrid/remote position.\n\nEdit2:\n\nMy company has a bad reputation of people quitting after 2-3 years. They have been trying to lock me down since 6 months of me working here, and told me they would want me to retire from this company because they struggle finding software engineers.\n\nEdit3:\n\nIt definitely seems the vast majority highly advise against a giant contract like that. So thank you all for helping me understand I definitely DO NOT want a 10 year long contract. Yall saved me a massive amount of time lol.\n\nThe reason I was considering a contract is because I fear my skills won't transfer to a new developer position, so sticking with a company where I know my skills are valued is comforting. Even so, i now see something like a 10 year contract is not the way to go.",1al3bbt,35,1707313715

343,Feeling unsure about accepting offer,"Hi folks! \n\nSo I've been interviewing for 3 jobs, I live in a very HCOL area where my rent is $2750 a month. I am working on my master's at the moment and plan on being done in 14 months. \n\nInfo below:\n\n (recruiter has told me I am the top choice, waiting to hear back about potential offer) Director/150k- the company is a private sector comms and consulting firm. Haven't had the best interactions with the interviewers, I kept thinking we just didn't vibe but I was then sent over to further interviews, and the final interview with the founder just felt as equally as strange as the initial interviews. The workload seems super easy to me however it's not a super wellknown firm so I'm not sure if it would help much resume wise. This job is also 15 min from my apartment currently which is awesome, I'd be in office 2x a week. Really just not sure about the team since every interaction I've had so far they've either been late to the interview or not paying attention. \n\nPending offer: Senior Comms Consultant/110k- fairly well known company not in the big 4 of govt consulting but it's making its way there. I loved the team I met and had only one interview. I initially told the recruiter the lowest I'd feel comfortable with was 130k. I do not have any experience in this sector I would be working in, however I know the workload would be pretty minimal for me and my experience. I found out the cap for this role is at $115k. The office is 40 min away without traffic, I'd need to be onsite 2x a week. From reading online, it doesn't seem like those at this company get paid very well, which of course makes me worried. The benefits are decent.\n\n(First set of interviews) Senior Comms Corp Consultant/110k- budget they listed online went up to $149k was super disappointed to hear the budget is only able to go to $110k. This is a large healthcare company, great benefits, and is 10 min walking from my apartment. I am confident that showing I've worked here would help me long term.  However, reviews online have stated it is very difficult to get a pay bump unless promoted into a more senior role. I would be one role below a 'manager.' \n\n\nI know I should be ecstatic to receive an offer, but I'm feeling pretty discouraged as the take home for the last two jobs will be 78k after taxes etc. With rent being so high here, and my overall expenses being close to $5k a month (including rent, insurance, phone bill, car insurance, groceries etc) I'll have little to no money left over to save. I feel like the obvious choice is to take the higher paying job even though the team may suck.",1alvnn4,1,1707398757

345,How to clearly state I am specifically looking for entry-level jobs and won't leave because I'm 'overqualified'?,"I have a masters degree (TESOL) and have been working as a teaching assistant for years. I'm so burnt out with education and looking for a career change, so I've been applying to entry-level admin and receptionist roles in everything from schools to hotels to green energy companies (undergrad degree and original career aspiration). I'd be perfectly happy to be a receptionist at a green energy or recycling company, scheduling appointments and making sure people and the planet are a little bit happier. I don't need a big salary, just steady income. \n\nI strongly suspect the reason I haven't gotten a single call back is because of my MA, but I can't leave it off my resume because it's tied to my visa status. Employers will see I'm on a post-graduate visa when they check my right to work. I've put on my resume and cover letters that I'm seeking entry-level work and a career change, but I don't think I'm being explicit enough. How can I say I *want* to start from the bottom, I *want* an entry-level job, I *will not leave* if this job is a good fit as professionally as possible?",1alvmer,1,1707398653
346,Every interviewer I’ve gotten lately has shown up 20/30 minutes late or doesn’t call at all.,"\nI’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever find a job. I got laid off in September due to budget cuts and have been looking ever since. I had only been working there for 5 months and had been picked because I had the least seniority. I  was unemployed for about 6 months prior to getting that job. I apply to around 15 jobs a day and have had mid results. I’ve tried switching up my resume, had people critique my interview skills, asked for critiques on my portfolio and nothing has seemed to work. I’ve talked to previous employers and they tell me I’m a hard worker and a great asset but they have no room on their team or they are too far away from my location and I don’t have the ability to move right now. \n\nThe jobs that do respond to me often are scams. The ones that I am genuinely interested in get back to me months later or never follow through on the interview calls that they set up.  I’ve had 4 interviews in the past two weeks. The first two showed up 20/30 minutes late with no apologies or heads up. The last two, with one being today, reached out to me to set up a time and then never called. \n\nI know they say what’s meant for you will find you and what’s not will find its way out of your life but I’m honestly tired of struggling and just want a steady job that I don’t have to worry about. It really bothers me that when opportunity’s finally come through the people who are giving them to me don’t respect my time  and end up giving me false hope. \n\nI wasn’t expecting this post to be long.

348,Switching from CS to IB/Finance,"edit: IB is definitely a stretch given my gpa and school, but generally any finance role is what i’m aiming for \n\nI’m currently a third year college student at UC Davis, no previous experience, and after over  +300 applications for internships in the CS field I’m hoping to start applying to finance instead. CS Major, low 3.0 gpa\n\nMy reasoning is that I’ve realized how little I understand about coding and software in general, whereas I know a lot more about investing, accounting, all things I’ve been interested in since high school. I love value investing and trading stocks and have made a sizeable sum, but previously thought there was a more reliable career for me in CS. I’ve read countless books on investing and stock trading and now feel maybe I should have pursued this from the beginning, but now I’m worried about my lack of qualifications and do not know how to get experience or internship opportunities. I’ve also run a semi successful stock alerts community and had a couple viral youtube videos if that would be helpful on a new resume. Any advice on my current situation?

349,I am in my early thirties and need advice on career change. Can you advise me based on my interests?,"I know, I'm a bit late for it, but I basically want to restart my career path as my earlier choices don't really reflect my interests, which lead me to burn out early (I worked office jobs as a translator). I am a linguist and I am fluent in English and German and at intermediate level of Russian. Plus the usual transferrable skills, such as attention to detail, teamwork, etc. that multinational companies require. These are my current skills.\n\nMy interests are: ecology & environment (I love nature), birding, conservation, interior design, video editing, sustainable technologies, history, geography, flying (free flying, such as hanggliding), music (I have a quasi perfect pitch), acting (although I can only imagine this as a hobby at this point), electronics (I have no knowledge of that but would be keen to learn about it), travelling, networking, language learning. \n\nI know this is a wide array of interests. As you can see most are related to either nature or creative tasks. E.g. I thought about working in sustainable technologies.\n\nThe problem is that I don't have the necessary qualifications for this. I currently have a Bachelor's degree in International Relations. So restarting my career would essentially require me to restart my education. But as it consumes money and precious time I would need a certain plan as to what exactly to learn and where. I'm not sure I'd need another BA degree, although that would be preferable. \n\nMy current location is Hungary, although I strongly suspect I'll be studying and working elsewhere as I'd like to leave my country for a better place to live in.\n\nI'd welcome any tips and advice, as well as examples from your own lives of a successful career change in any of these or related, fields.

353,Do recruiters like to see an earlier graduation date?,"For example, I am a 3rd year undergrad with an accounting internship and next recruiting season I plan on applying to two different types of full-time jobs which are, consulting/advisory and accounting positions, with resumes tailored towards each job application. Let’s say I plan on working towards my CPA, in the case that I receive a consulting offer there would be no reason for me to pursue the CPA, which would mean that I could graduate early instead of taking the extra credits required for CPA licensure. \n\nIf I were to put in my tailored consulting resume that I have an early graduation date would that help me in the recruiting process?

355,Is it normal to hate your job and feel like quitting all the time?,"23m making 75k plus 10% bonus in a LCOL city. Have about 2 years of experience now, I use to enjoy my job up until this past summer when my old boss left. I was asked to take on all his responsibilities, and also asked to train my new manager in addition to the new hire (who during the interview process I did not think was a good fit). I asked about a raise/promotion after some time, and was told that it wasn't in budget and no promotion slots were open. My new manager now micromanages everything after I train him on it (literally from square one), and tries to add his own touch on former business processes that I use to own and ran fine before that I learned from my old boss. When I am not in the daily 3-4 hours of 'team meetings' of me showing him and the other new guy how to do something, he is checking in every hour or so to see how things are coming along. His new 'solutions' are a lot less efficient, take up way more time and effort than what we already had, and he gets upset at me when I don't know something that my old boss use to cover (I have less than 2 years of experience in the role, my old boss was here for 8+ years so they can't expect a 1 to 1 replacement). The new hire is laughably incompetent, I mean the dude is 4 months in and completely and utterly messes up people's names on the regular still and honestly I debate whether he has a bunch of bodies buried in his basement. It makes sense that he was unemployed and had a string of sporadic 2-3 month contract jobs before we hired him, and was fired from every long term job he had before-- top brass said we needed to fill the seat. On top of that, due to the work piling up I've had to work late most nights and on the weekend sometimes. My new boss was very excited last week to tell me about my 8% raise I received at the start of the year... even though I had know about it for almost a month already. 8% does not seem to correlate with all my new responsibilities and babysitting.\n\nI've gone from tolerating/sometimes enjoying my job, to absolutely hating each and every day. I want to quit all the time, but I am unsure about quitting without a job lined up. Financially, I am doing well with no debt and enough saved up to cover at least 6 months of expenses, but the market seems so tough right now. I've been looking for a job since October, and have had countless interviews. Phone screens, virtual meetings, in-person interviews, you name it. I stopped keeping track at this point, I have several interviews a week and probably 40-50 in total since October. I've had up to 3 interviews in a day, and made it to third and fourth round interviews but then am hit with radio silence or a rejection email weeks later. Oftentimes I am told other candidates have more experience... it seems like I am in a weird spot of not having much numerical years of experience despite good technical/hands on experience, and looking for a higher salary. I'm open to lateral moves too, literally before my old boss left he told me that once I got to his position I should look at other jobs because they shoe-horn you in here. I want a career, not a plateau. I've spoke to my current boss several times now for shits and gigs about creating a growth plan but he is not receptive towards working on one. Has anyone else quit their jobs without having something lined up? I feel like its a bad choice, but my personal relationships and mental health are deteriorating from this place. Idk if I suck at interviews or what, but I am targeting 85-95k and with ~2 YOE plus training experience feel like that should be within reach. Is that realistic?\n\n***EDIT*** Seems like this is pretty common across careers, especially in the beginning. Even more so if you don't love what you are doing. You can switch jobs, find other things to appreciate in life, stick out the shitty parts until things get better, or do nothing. Choice is yours.",1akkcxb,144,1707252907

The concept revolves around establishing a mini digital agency specializing in supporting startups within our industry. This agency would primarily serve my network having worked in the space for many years and connections—friends of friends, former colleagues, etc.\n\nThe primary focus of this venture would be on strategy and consulting services, providing valuable insights and support to emerging businesses. I've assessed that this won't encroach upon my existing role; it's separate in terms of the clients I would speak to and services offered. The plan is to build an online presence through a dedicated website, leveraging my network to generate referrals for the agency.\n\nMy role in this endeavor would primarily be centered around client acquisition and ensuring smooth operations. The actual work would be executed by a team of professionals I've assembled, leaving me in a supervisory and coordination capacity.\n\nHowever, my main concern lies in the legal and ethical aspects of initiating such a venture without explicitly informing my current employer. While the clients and projects would differ, I want to ensure I navigate this situation appropriately.\n\nHas anyone faced a similar scenario or have insights into the legalities and best practices surrounding side businesses in a similar industry? Your guidance would be immensely valuable as I contemplate this step. Thank you!\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is all I could see in the employee contract that was relevant. \n\n12. Exclusivity of Service \n1.

384,How do I decide between these two internship options?,"Context: University student currently on a fellowship abroad. For my remaining 4 months, I will be working an internship. I am going to graduate school this fall, and my goal is a career in research.\n\nThe first internship fits perfectly within my research interests. It is an industry company in the field I would like to go into for my career. However, there is a long commute time, and the schedule would be much more strict. The language of work is also not my native language (English). While my foreign language skills are good enough to survive, I will probably have quite a bit of trouble in a work place where the foreign language is the main language of communication. Not just from a work standpoint (i.e. following instructions), but also from a social standpoint. I would like to integrate into the workplace, but that would be quite difficult when I can't follow the conversation. Additionally, the job is in a region of the country that is known for being rather conservative. There's a reasonable change that I'll face some sort of discrimination either as a foreigner or a person of color.\n\nThe second internship is less relevant to my intended profession. However, it is so close I can walk to work, and the schedule is very flexible. The main language within the workplace is English, so communication and social integration will be much less problematic. The city is very liberal and I am already acquainted with the lab, which has a number of foreigners, so I know I will not face any discrimination on that front. I admit that a large part of the reason I want to work this internship is purely because I want to spend the remainder of my time here relaxing. I want to take as many weekend trips as possible and meet up with friends who are scattered around the country. Outside of travel, I would have a lot more time to engage in extracurriculars.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, I would go for the first internship. It's a bit childish to choose an internship because it's more comfortable. However, this decision doesn't have a huge impact on my future. I am already accepted/denied from whatever graduate schools I have applied to, so it does not affect my applications. I have no interest in working for this company in the future, so the connections I would build are useful, but not that useful. And I cannot imagine a world where an internship I did during undergrad would be meaningful on my CV after I've already graduated a doctorate program.\n\nFurthermore, this opportunity is rather unprecedented. I'm on a fellowship, so most of my expenses are already paid for. Once I finish my classes, I will have nothing to worry about. These 4 months will probably be the last opportunity for me to explore this country in such a way for the forseeable future. I mean, when in life do you have 4 months of 0 responsibility and such endless opportunity? I will have plenty of time to work on the research projects I'm interested in once I am in graduate school, however this is probably the last time I will ever experience this setting.\n\nIf it sounds like I am already convinced, that's because I am. The reason I am making this post is because I brought this up to a friend who disagrees with my reasoning. So I wanted an outside opinion in case my reasoning truly is stupid, and I'm about to make a big mistake. I would appreciate any insight on this.",1alqgg7,1,1707378309

389,Do i move on?,"Hi, sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile. Please be as respectful as you can about this as I’m at a loss and I don’t know how to gauge any of it.\n\nI’m 20yo, accepted a position as a biller at a small billing company. I have an associates degree and my high school diploma.\n\nI’ve been at this job for a year and a half. I’m making $15 an hour. I also recently moved an hour away from the office, because I was living check to check at my apartment closer to the office. I moved back in with family.\n\nThis is where things get tricky- we’re a small company. My manager currently used to be a coworker of mine at a restaurant. They decided they liked my work ethic and asked me if I wanted out of the service industry. I said yes! Please! First big girl job at 20 in healthcare with set hours and benefits? Sign me up!\n\nEveryone in the office is tight knit. Like, family friends type shit. They’ve known each other for 8+ years. Everyone knows everything about everyone. Initially, I thought this was cool- being friends with the managers. Not so much anymore.\n\nI was hired as an account manager but have just been floating. I don’t have any accounts, but I handle tasks they throw at me as needed. Lately I’ve become someone who they dump everything onto. I feel like I have no official role in the office, I just do everyone’s backwash work (for lack of better words). People give me tasks they find too difficult or tasks they simply don’t want to do. This isn’t what I was hired for.\n\nI’m asked to run errands for my boss. I pick up lunch almost every day for the office per managers request and am not compensated for it. I pick up their kids from school upon request and am not compensated for it. At first, I thought this was their way of making friends, but after a year of busting my ass and not getting a simple “thank you”, it feels like I’m being used. Maybe this is normal and I’m asking too much.\n\nI was promised a raise a year, but it wasn’t in my contract so I’m unable to enforce it. They tell me I need to go to the higher up boss to ask for a raise, but that I need to meet him in person. He lives out of state and the only conferences they have are for managers only. They’ve given the two newest employees raises, and they’ve only been here 6 & 8 months. \n\nEssentially, the only work I do is assigned to me by my boss. I’ve tried to take the initiate of helping out where else it’s needed (backing up another coworker, physically cleaning the office, asking if I can help elsewhere) but I’m never given anything and have been reprimanded for helping another coworker.\n\nI’m told I’m a star employee, I’m flexible, I’m awesome at my job, etc. but I’m not being treated or paid like I am.\n\nI know for some people it sounds like a no brainer, but I’m new to the corporate world and have no scope on this. My idea or plan currently is to wait until my two year mark and ask for either a raise, or that I’m able to work remote because of moving an hour away. But part of me wants to say fuck it and start looking for other jobs now. Some people I’ve asked for advice tell me to look elsewhere, that I can make more money easily. Others tell me to stick it out.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\nSincerely, a lost 20yo",1al9ca3,1,1707329215

393,Lowball offer to relocate,"Late last year I got covid for the first time, and it sucked at worse than I thought it would. I've been a remote worker in the analytical equipment industry for about 6 years. During the height of my feverish delusion, I was convinced that I was going to be fired because my management was pressuring me to finish a bunch of work before the end of the year. It turned out they had gotten wind that another department was going to approach me about a position and they were fairly certain I'd take it. The job is actually great and something I really think I'd enjoy and excel at, and as the only person in my company of a few thousand who's ever worked in the industry that we service, I'm uniquely qualified. On it's face, my only complaint is that this role is focused on the Americas rather than global like my current role, but it's still a promotion, so there's room to move back to a global focus later. Weirdly, the position also requires relocation to the bay area, despite us not having an office there, and while we have customers and potential customers in the bay area, it makes up less than 5 percent in the Americas. I live near a relatively inexpensive city on the east coast, but I like northern California, so I'm open to the relocation for the right position. The city I live in is actually the third largest hub for the industry behind the bay area, and is very under serviced, so it's not a bad place to be. \n\nI finally got the offer last week and I was shocked when the hr person was very excited about 'how much' they'd been able to get for me. It was a 15% increase from my current position, and a relatively anemic relocation package. I did the math and if I moved 2-3 hours from sfo, the 15% bump would equate to a 15% pay cut. Obviously, I'm not going to take that deal, but I'm not sure what to do. \n\nI just drafted a counter offer but I included two scenarios, with data to back up my rationale. Scenario 1 was a 25% increase in pay and I don't have to relocate, since I can do the job just as well from any location. The pay increase feels reasonable since I bring critical industry  knowledge/connections and will have a direct impact on revenue from our fastest growing industry in our most underperforming regions. Scenario 2 is a 65% increase in pay and a 120% increase in the relocation package. The initial offer kind of soured me on relocating at all, but without a doubt, I'm not willing to uproot my life for anything less than an amazing opportunity. If they accept this counter, I might just take the pay bump and pay for my own travel out there when needed, but never actually use the relo money (though this might be unethical and a fireable offense), just kind of drag my feet past the unofficial 6 month transition period. I could honestly afford a small apartment at that rate in Vacaville or Sacramento, and actually show residency and have a place to stay while in town, though I'm not a fan of the state tax rate. I'm also thinking of saying that I want the relocation cost repayment clause taken out unless they're guaranteeing employment for that length of time. Scenario 1 would save the company closer to $100k in relocation package, and a significant amount in salary, ands the only downside I can see is that it wouldn't look as impressive as it would if we had someone 'dedicated' to the bay area, even if it's not actually true. \n\nNow this whole thing is complicated by the fact that the day before I got the offer an old colleague reached out because they're having a really hard time finding someone with my profile, and do I know anyone. I said, 'well... there's me...' and he immediately responded with a dinner invite. At dinner he said he didn't think I'd leave my company, which is why he didn't ask me directly. At the end of the night he asked me if I'd be willing to relocate to the west coast, and I did yes, but I'd rather not. He then kind of sheepishly explained that the company pays significantly more for west coast workers, but that the remote pay wasn't terrible, and said they'd probably offer me an amount 2.5x my current salary but suggested I try to negotiate for a number 3x my salary. I really did my best to not spit my drink all over him. Now this job is nebulous, as in I don't know if I'll end up getting an offer, while the original is concrete. If I make the counter and they accept one of them, but in a month a get a MUCH better offer and leave the company all together, I'm going to feel like a real ass hat. \n\nAny thoughts on how to navigate this? How crazy is making two parallel counter offers? What about leaving before you even have a chance to transition into a new role within the company?",1al8wid,1,1707328152

Unfortunately, I don't have any skills needed to do the job. I'm only applying because I need the money. \n\nMy first job is being an office admin worker. Minimum wage ($6.50/DAY) and I don't get to do much. The only thing I hate is the 3 hour commute everyday. I was busy attending gallery events, doing network and putting my name out there so I was always absent. The manager suggested I should resign.\r\n\nMy second job is online during the lockdown. I was tasked to help design a book cover. I'm not good at graphic design but had to lie because I badly need the job. I have excuse after excuse after excuse of not executing or doing my work properly: bad internet, power outage, storm. My contract was only for a month, and I ghosted them in the last 3 days. I had another freelance job with the same responsibilities and I ghosted the client too.\r\n\nMy final job I was fired immediately because of a misunderstanding, I didn't send the correct invoice. It was an okay job, and I worked for a year. Now I'm looking for a new job and I realized that I can never have my former employees/clients as my reference because I failed in all those jobs. \r\n\nI guess I wasn't good at these jobs is because they're not really what I want to do and I feel forced to do them because it feeds me and pays the expenses. I interned at an art gallery before and I did well at that. Unfortunately, the gallery wasn't hiring so I wasn't employed there. \r\n\nI'm looking for any career advice, how to deal with the anxiety of being discovered that I sucked at my previous jobs, not having character references, etc. I just want to hear from all of you here.",1al877m,0,1707326444
405,LinkedIn - Helping or Hurting?,"This article (Wired - LinkedIn’s New AI Chatbot Wants to Help You Find Your Next Job) covers a suite of tools that LinkedIn started rolling out at the end of last year.\n\nOne perspective, this is another tool helping job hunters fight the good fight. It's a problem that company culture and benefits are unknown and this seems to be giving applicants a preview into the companies and benefits they should expect.\n\nBut, this data is only as good as what's provided by the company.\n\nCandidly, we see the most value in the 'extract career advice from posts and articles' feature. There is SO much content on LinkedIn and big population of workers looking to switch roles/industries. They may have the baseline skills but having a feed of what is seen as 'hard skills' could be helpful.\n\nOn the flip side, this could push the volume of applications going through the platform and flood ATS which is already happening.\n\nWe're about to be permanently in the 'co-pilot' career world.\n\nAny experience, negative or positive, with LinkedIn's new features?

Recently my boss was promoted and because of that I am now the lead onsite administrator, but I was told I wouldn’t be getting a pay raise. \n\nWhat makes it even worse is 6 months ago I had my yearly review and asked for a raise and a title change to senior onsite administrator because of the growth I have had since I started. I was told no. Now I’m getting the title change I wanted but without the raise.

411,What do I do with my life?,"So I have to say, I don't know about any of you, but I hate this rut. I am 'head of hr' for a sales firm, but what that means is that I recruit people ever hour of every day to see if they want to do door to door sales. I hate this. I've done this for two years now. They promised growth, and yea, my title has grown, but my responsibilities are the exact same as when I started as a recruiter. I keep thinking 'I can't wait until I can retire.'. I'm not even thirty yet! This job isn't bad, don't get me wrong. I get paid 45k/y, it's fully remote, and I don't always have a boss breathing down my throat. But, I have a quota I need to make by hiring x about of people every week. I never speak to the same person more than once, and if I do it's because there's a problem, and if I don't preform well enough in my cold calls for hr then that's the only time my boss even acknowledges my existence. I want consistency, I want to be able to build relationships and actually feel like I'm making a difference. I'm not saying that I don't want to work remote, although it would let me build relationships, but I'm loosing my motivation to just participate in society. I used to work in warehouse and I would tell myself 'It's not the best job, but everyone has to do something to help out.', but is it selfish to say that I don't want to help out? That I just want to do my own thing and not call random people every day?

I'm turning 30 soon and all I want is to either go back to where I was a kid and didn't have to worry about my next paycheck, or to fast forward forty years in the future and skip the best years of my life that way I don't have to slave away every day. I don't know what to do. I've tried looking for other jobs, and I always get to the final interview, but they always choose someone else. I've had 15 interviews in the past year and it's always the same thing. They call me up after  and tell me that they loved getting to know me and it was a hard decision, but they decided to choose someone who's prior experiance aligned better with the job.

Or should I just stick it out at this new role for 6 months-12 months before reaching out to the recruiter from the mid-sized firm?\n\nMy main concern about reaching out now is I’m worried that the mid-sized firm will push back and ask if I’m sure that I gave the industry role a fair chance since I’ve only been there for 4 months.",1allg81,2,1707360846

417,2 Job Offers,"Hello everyone, so here is a very long story. I am a 23 year old adult who graduated last year with their Bachelor’s degree in education but was not certified to teach at a public school. So what I had to do was apply to Kokua Education to be a substitute for Idea Public Schools and work through many campuses to prove my worth so they can hire me as an uncertified teacher which they typically do and get certified through them. Recently I have been stressing out about money because I don’t make a lot as a substitute acutally barely to cover any of my utilities. However this one particular school has had their eye on me and the Assistant principal invited for me to apply to the following school year 24-25 for one their teaching positions. I haven’t gotten an interview as of now but I was thinking of getting a 2nd job which I did receive at the bank for answering customer inquiries for like $16 an hour which is slightly higher than the daily pay as a sub. The only issue is it is $16 an hour and but there is room for growth and promotion. I’m afraid if i get the teaching job in like August, I would have to leave my bank job Since I was considering it since I don’t get paid in the summer as a sub. I don’t know if i should stick to my bank job or get the job as a teacher for high school students which are my favorites. I was also offered a long term position from the school for only 2 months but don’t know if I should accept or deny it due to only have a secure job 2 months then again having to look for shifts as a sub. The only thing is after April when the job ends I would go back to regular sub schedule and unpredicted days if I will work or not until the end of the school year which is until May and no summers which is why I wanted to get the 2nd job now to prevent being unpaid during that time. My bank seemed very friendly and I got along very smoothly with the team and management. There is opportunities to grow for the bank and I also getting my MBA in case things don’t work out for my career as a teacher I have lots of experience in the retail world as well as teaching..However the school that has been having their eye on me, it has been too good to me and I LOVE IT! PROS for bank: Work life balance, opportunities to grow, PTO, easy tasks, already know people and get along with them, awesome work culture. Cons: boring tasks, customers, having to dress up for bank, having little hours in the beginning. Pros for teacher: can make a career, can finally try it out after unsuccessfully being unemployed as a teacher a year after graduation, working with high schoolers, motivating them, making a difference, paid vacations, awesome work culture, a sense of satisfaction. Cons: no work life balance, pressure for testing, lots of time taken into grading, lesson planning, unsure if there is room to grow with my MBA, etc.  Agh, I don’t know what to do!!! I accepted the job offer from the bank and in the process of a background check. I don’t know what to choose, so far i haven’t gotten the interview yet as a teacher but I know its coming soon. Please help me make a decision, thank you!!! Please give me insight as to which is better to make a career out of and in my situation which way would I benefit most from???",1al7u13,1,1707325554

423,How do I deal with this insane micromanager? Advice please.,"Hoping this is the right subreddit. \n\nReally struggling with how to handle a situation with a new Sr. Director at work and would love some advice. \n\nFirst, history:\nI have been with my company for 11 years. I am currently in a principal analyst role with years of glowing reviews. I am reporting to someone at a manager level whom I have worked with for 8 years and has been my manager for 4 years. We have a great working relationship and have always had an amazing rapport. He reports to a director whom I have a wonderful working relationship also. She has been at the helm of our team working closely with all of us and our stakeholders throughout several big projects and implementations for the last 5 years. Our team also consists of 4 others who are all great contributors and I am very proud of all of us and the work we accomplish. We are an independent and collaborative team and do not fear reaching out to each other for assistance or anything we need. We have been lucky to have senior leadership that has historically placed a great amount of trust in us and we've operated with a good level of autonomy.  \n\n\nWhich brings me to the issue...\nOur Sr. Director was let go (due to a reduction in force) and our CIO had just retired. Another Sr. director in IT had just been hired 7 months prior (for what exact role, Idk) under a different senior leader. He found his way over as the Sr. Director overseeing our team and another business systems team about 4 months ago.\n\nSince he has been in this position, he slowly started to involve himself in every detail of our work. He asks to be invited to every single meeting we have with each other or our business partners. He has implemented several project tracking softwares and has several meetings week to go over them. He has scheduled several demos with third party applications that he thinks will help us do our job faster or better) so far not one of these has been able to meet our needs). He does not have the knowledge of our system to understand most of the technical pieces we are talking about so he schedules more meetings so we can teach him. He has been adamant about certain projects that the business says they don't want but he thinks will make us look good or be a 'quick win'. I have spoken up in a few meetings about the ideas he is pushing and simply ask 'what do our customers (the business) say?'. He immediately schedules a 1:1 with me to talk about his priorities. He has asked us all to share our calendars with him and he goes through meetings he thinks we don't need to have an asks us to cancel them. This is a level of micromanaging I have never experienced or even heard about. I don't know what someone at his level is doing trying to be involved in the day to day work we are doing. I'm so confused. Everyone is scared to say anything because of his retaliatory 1:1's. The list goes on and on. My manager and director are at their wits end and have discussed looking for another job. We are all exhausted by him and feel like our team has just disintegrated from this once happy and collabortive team to just trying to get the basic shit done while holding his hand through it and doing whatever he wants us to do.\n\nI really feel like he is just trying to make his position relevant... His role over our team adds no value and is making is all miserable. \n\nI'm so depressed at my job that I once really truly loved. I don't know what to do. Is this a scenario worth reporting to HR? Do I somehow find a way to go to my CIO (even though that feels so inappropriate for my level)?",1alli7w,4,1707361013

438,[NE] Total Compensation Includes PTO and Holidays,"Background: I work at a medium sized non-profit with all 40 salaried staff working remotely. We recently brought on a Chief of Staff with an extensive corporate background that didn’t include HR. He now heads up our HR and sent out a total compensation package letter for each employee. This was the first time this has been done at the organization but aligns with the CEO’s desire to have the org run in a more corporate structure. \n\nWe accrue rolling PTO, have 11 paid holidays, and a week off when the org shuts down after implementing our signature event. For the industry, these are relatively generous benefits. \n\nHowever, my total compensation letter included a value based on my salary for my PTO, holidays, and week off for org shut-down. \n\nQuestion: Is it standard practice to include days off like that in the total compensation amount?

449,7 Months active job search to find senior level job after Layoff,"  \n\nI don’t know who needs to see this post or what value it may bring. \n\nMy experience searching for a managerial role in IT Infrastructure for decent pay and benefits has been a rollercoaster ride. I struggled with being over-qualified for entry to mid-level jobs, while simultaneously being denied part jobs as a cashier at Walgreens. It has taken me a little of 6 months and 30 interviews (phone screens, in-person interviews, recorded interviews, second & third round technical interviews) to finally receive an offer for a mid-level manager job as an IT Manager. \n\nThe work search is a dreadful grinding experience, and the tech interview process is absurdly lengthy. I felt so dejected after investing nearly 20 hours preparing and interviewing, and testing, for a single IT job interview, only to receive another rejection letter. Repeating this process month after month is awful. \n\nMy time off, in contrast, was wonderful. I spent time with my family, completing home projects, cooking meals, and being outside in the sun. Additionally, I am fortunate to have collected unemployment pay that helped offset monthly bills. \n\nHere are some numbers to help anyone who’s in the middle of their ‘layoff journey.’\n\n1. In 6 months, I sent 200 tailored resumes and cover letters to job listings.\n\n2. Only 57 companies replied when I wasn’t selected in the initial round of candidates and thanked me for applying.\n\n3. I had 20 interviews where I made it to the second round.\n\n4. I had 2 interviews where I didn’t make it past the first round. \n\n5. I had 7 interviews where I went through the entire IT TECH interview process, was notified that I was one of two candidates being considered, and finally, wasn’t selected for the job position. \n\n6. I had one interview that resulted in a job offer and an actual set start date, only to have the job offer rescinded with no further explanation. \n\n7. The job I just accepted required 6 separate interviews, two tests, and 3 references who would be willing to write a full letter of recommendation. \n\nI felt horrible not having a job. With another job finally lined up, I was expecting to feel better, instead I still feel dread combined with gratitude. ",1alg3q2,7,1707346021

461,"Love my current employer, but got a substantial offer from a competitor. Looking for advice.","Short summary first, if you want more specific details, read on to the paragraphs below.\n\nI have been with my employer 7 years, I practically run the business. I love it here, I felt like I was making good money. But I recently got a 6 figure offer, which is really hard not to seriously consider. I'm a new father and this could be a huge change for us financially, but I'm kind of scared and heartbroken at the idea of even leaving this company I'm currently with. I'll list one job vs the other below in broad terms including benefits.\n\n85k @ 49ish hours a week(2023 #s, due for a raise), free dental and life insurance, 2 weeks of pto (about to go to 4), 2% up to 6% 401k match (horrible), 6 day work weeks M-F 7-3(ish) + Sat 8-4, no paid holidays. Incredible flexibility with scheduling. \n\nVS\n\n120k @ 50hrs, 4 weeks of pto + 6 sick days, 100% up to 4% 401k match (worth over 500k over 30 years), 5 day work weeks M-F 7-5 no weekends, paid holidays. 5 minutes further away.\n\nOur medical is through my wife's work so those benefits are irrelevant.\n\nI'm looking for advise on how to proceed. I'm due to meet with my owner to discuss my raise for this year, and I'm nervous to even discuss this with him. I'm going to meet the owners of this offer tomorrow at their place to see it and meet everyone. This is going to be pretty much immediately followed by me telling my owner we need to scheulde a lunch and that we need to talk. What advice does reddit have for this situation and how to discuss this with my current owner whom I genuinely really like and respect? If you need more info I'll get more detailed below.\n\n\nNow for the longer explanation.\n\nI've been here over 7 years now as of a few weeks ago, I've never stayed at one place this long before but it's nice. Our work group is like family which is hard to find in my industry. My owner is literally the most flexible person when it comes to scheduling, but he can't seem to help me stop working Saturdays and not take a 20% pay cut for it. He pays me very well all things considered (commission), but he doesn't have the largest business so I understand he is somewhat limited on what he can pay me. For example, if I was paid this exact same way at one of our 4 biggest stores (8 total) I would be making 150k+. For him to pay me anywhere near 120k would be like me making over 200k at most of our other locations. Plus the lack of a better 401k match and paid holidays doesn't exactly leave me feeling that appreciated by the company. \n\nMeanwhile this huge company, that another leader from within my company went to and seems to love, has made this substantial offer and they seem very nice over the phone. This is clearly a serious offer as they even sent emails with company info and benefit package. And while it kills me to even consider leaving this amazing company I love, that's a lot of money. \n\nI am going to be sitting down with my owner 1 on 1 here very soon, we were due for it anyways and I don't expect he'll see this coming at all. I'm clearly very happy and very much so running the show, but I'm also a new dad and want weekends and holidays and the extra money is so substantial. He will be expecting me to ask for more money, but I feel like practically demanding 110k at least from mid 80s is going to blindside him. \n\nI'm great with my owner and we have great chemistry and can talk things out. But for the first time ever, I'm afraid of having this discussion. When he laughs it off and says maybe in a few years but you haven't even broke mid 90s yet, how do I approach him with this offer I have. How do I explain I had randomly updated my resume and just made it available online for employers to view. More than anything, I want to stay, but not for 20k less than this offer, plus all those benefits. That's simply too much to say no to. I'm sure I could leave on the best of terms and understanding on his part and potentially come back years layer if things don't work out. They rehire stars like me all the time that left for 'something better,' but I would never be viewed in the same light by the ownership group, which is something I was hoping to enter eventually. But I don't want to leave, I'm ok with 110 instead of their 120 to stay, but I don't think that discussion is going to go well. It would really hurt everyone financially if I left. \n\nHow should I discuss this with him and how best can I answer some of his questions about how I got the offer and present it to him? Sorry for the long post and thanks for any advice.",1alnvus,2,1707368566
462,FDIC Loan Servicing Job - NYC,Hi everyone - in August I was interviewed for a contract role with the FDIC for a loan servicing specialist in NYC. I got my offer in September and then didn’t hear back until mid December where I interviewed with a Federal Investigator. To say the least it was pretty intense and lasted about 4 hours. We covered everything about my personal and professional life. He said he’d reach out if he had any questions… I have yet to hear back from the FDIC or the talent agency I went through. Anyone else on the same boat? Is this normal wait time? Anyone know someone who’s being contracted for this special project due to the collapse of a few banks last year? I initially was told by my recruiter in August that I would be there by Christmas time..If I didn’t pass my security clearance would I be notified or is it possible to just be ghosted by them? Any information helps!!! Thanks…,1albjt0,1,1707334686

469,Tricked into a position I didn’t want,As the title states I was tricked into a position I didn’t want. I was a manager of a high performing team. Senior management came to me and said they had a struggling group that was not meeting KPIs and asked if I could move over for 6 months to help turn things around. I was hesitant as I liked the group I was working in. Eventually I agreed under the condition that I would be brought back into the group after 6 months. 3 months in and I’ve turned things around pretty well in the new group.

470,Sharing some unfortunate in my work recently...,"I recently got fired and I think it’s unfair... I wanted to share to see what you think regarding it. Also, I want to ask if it will be harder to find a job after being fired.\n\nAt the end of 2022, I was asked to hop onto a design project I never touched on (the original person responsible for left). My manager was not happy that I was not able to pick up the stuff right away and claimed that this was the whole reason I got hired 1 year ago. Note that I did not work on this type of task for over 1 year and when I worked on it, I was an intern. \n\nI didn’t take it as anything negative. At the beginning of 2023, I took the initiative and asked my manager if we could set up a monthly check-up to make sure that I am catching up and performing well on the task. My manager agreed to set it up as a 6-month goal. One mistake that I made here is that I agreed with my manager to not have a paper document which leads to my disadvantage in the future.\n\nDuring the time, my manager never set up any meetings with me to help me succeed or check on my progress. I took the initiative and reached out to my manager. Every month, I receive good feedback. At the 6 months mark - June, my manager told me that I had met the goal, I’ve improved, kept doing what I was doing, and there shouldn't be an issue to have a position change by the end of the year. \n\nIn September, I had an incident with one of the employees - she was disrespecting me and yelling at me throughout the whole call for 45 minutes. I reached out to my manager and sought help because it was not the first time that this person had yelled at me before. My manager did not have my back. She straight up asked me “Is it because your design is bad?” In my opinion, regardless my design is bad, yelling in a professional setting should not be allowed. My manager never resolved this incident.\n\nAfter this event, my project was slowly taken away from my hand and by the end of the year during my annual review, my manager denied everything she said to me for the whole year and said I did not do any work this year and did not improve at all. I asked my manager if she could provide any evidence, but she denied it. \n\nAfter the review meeting, I reached out to my coworkers to ask for feedback, they are all positive. So, I sent an email to my manager and asked for a follow-up meeting to discuss it. One week later, when I hopped on the call, I was not allowed to ask any questions regarding the annual review comments. Instead, I was thrown a performance improvement plan and on there, it also stated “combative communication.” ",1alnhkz,2,1707367247
471,Moving to a new role but HR said no negotiations. Salary is the around the same for my counterparts staying in a city with lower cost of living. What do I do,"I received a call yesterday for an offer for a new role based in a city with a high cost of living. The average rent is about $1900 more in the new city compared to my current city. The difference in salary for the more costly city and the less costly city is 5k. This is uniform across my peers (we are in a program and shared our salaries with each other). I believe the salary should be higher for the same position in a more costly city. My program manager told me there would be higher pay for a more costly city but 5k wont even cover the yearly difference in rent. \n\nI’d like to negotiate, but when I took the call, the HR representative said that there is no negotiations.

488,Seeking Advice: Negotiating Salary for Associate Role at JP Morgan Chase with Technical Experience,"I am currently interviewing for a job at JP Morgan Chase. It is an associate role on a strategy team but it seems like they are looking for someone who is a little technical. I have a background in business analytics and cloud engineering. I have about 2.5 years of experience and a major tech company on my resume.\n\nThe associate role is based in NYC and the recruiter told me the base pay salary range was between $105K and $115K, with total compensation probably being closer to $135K to $145K. She also told me that the base pay would probably be on the higher end of that range. The recruiter asked if the range was satisfactory, and I told her something along the lines of that this was a good starting point.\n\nOn the actual job description, it had the base pay listed as $128,500 to $135K. So I was a little thrown off when she said the slightly lower base pay range. I am not even close to having an offer yet, as I still need to go through multiple rounds of interviews. But I just want to be prepared should I receive an offer to negotiate.\n\nI currently make $110K base pay and live somewhere where I do not have state income taxes.

I do not like my job and am very interested in this opportunity, but the cost of living in NYC really scares me. \n\nIs this a fair salary range? Should I push for the original range that was advertised on the job description? Or do I just ask for $120K or $125K? Or do I just accept whatever they give me and not negotiate?

The reason why the answer isn't easy is because most of the top Master's in Finance programs are based in Europe (the top ranked MIF programs in the US is at USC Marshall and it places at number 33 on the list (Financial Times)) so it would make sense for top US finance firms to be very interested in graduates from these European universities, but on the other hand, it would also make sense for the companies to be mostly interested in US graduates because they got local knowledge that might be more relevant.\n\nThank you!",1al9nf3,0,1707329980
490,suspended with pay- any advice?,"Hi everyone, I need some advice, I’m currently working at a call center and we have these things called break codes. 1 is for non direct work such as meetings, 9 is for direct after call work, such as call backs and 2 is for when you go on breaks. So we often make outbound calls to clients informing them of debt, we’re basically debt collectors. I honestly really don’t like this job, but i’m afraid to leave without having something else lined up first. Often times people just hang up on us which I don’t blame them for. Btw i’m in Australia.\n\nSo what happened was, in the 4 months i’ve been working there, we were not adequately trained, and there is no physical support, only virtual, who take quite a while to answer which isn’t very professional on call, as the client can only be on hold for a maximum of 5 minutes. We’re required to send letters/ messages at times which can take around 10 minutes but we can only be doing after call work for 5 to meet KPIs, we’re only supposed to use BC9 for calling people back, not writing letters, but my friend and I sometimes used it anyway as without we would be bombarded with messages asking why we took longer than 5 minutes. Everything is screen recorded by the way. And I admit sometimes we were in BC9 for too long just talking to eachother which I know we shouldn’t have done.\n\nRecently i guess the call center did an audit on the break codes and found the people that were using them too much. For me they said I had to leave immediately as an investigation was being done and to return in 2 days to see the outcome. The next day they had a meeting with my friend where they had a list of every time they used the break code and he was scared, he didn’t have an explanation and tried to tell them it was because he was unwell. They accused him of wage theft and fraud and said they would tell him the outcome tomorrow. Now i’m scared for my meeting with them tomorrow.\n\nThis is where I need advice..

I have been very consistent and productive with my work and my manager has often praised my work. I want to ask for a pay raise but I also don’t want to create a cold environment if that’s a bad idea. They have been paying me good according to average job salary in the area but less than my other colleagues. That’s also because they asked for pay raise last year and I didn’t. I am an international employee and they have also sponsored for my green card process. The company does pay raise at the start of the year for everyone but that’s just matching the inflation rate or a little over that. Recently, I completed a project and the company have successfully done demo with the perspective clients. In this situation, should I ask a pay raise with my employer or wait until June/july because they did yearly pay raise just a month ago? Or should I wait until my immigration process settle? I need some suggestions here. Thank you.",1alm5gq,2,1707362982

I learned about the restructure and a new opportunity on my team, set up a Teams meeting with boss to ask a few questions about the restructure and express interest in the new role, she accepted the meeting invite and when I joined the call, SURPRISE!! Someone from HR was on the line. Manager read from a script, HR read from a script, last day is the end of the month.\n\nInstead of caring about my wellbeing, my managers have seemed more concerned about how we communicate the news to my colleagues (presumably so my colleagues don't get freaked out that yet another one of us is getting laid off). **I almost spit out my coffee when my boss suggested she could 'send an email to the team stating that \\[MY NAME\\] has MADE THE DECISION TO LEAVE.'** What. The. Fuck??\n\nDoes anyone know if this is a common thing-- employers lay someone off then try to spin it as the employee making the decision to leave? I get that it puts management in a better light, but do you see any benefit at all in framing this as my decision instead of stating that I will no longer be with company after X date? It's my layoff, I want to frame it on my own terms, and certainly don't want anyone to blatantly lie about my reason for leaving.\n\nMy department and the company as a whole are totally dysfunctional and I've been miserable since I started.

Let me begin by saying that this person is literally the most toxic, rude, and condescending person I have ever encountered. Every time I receive her message on teams, I get extremely anxious and stressed that I need to interact with her and just wanna kill myself. This person would ask to call me for help for almost everything (literally 1-2 minute calls) when she could just drop a message or email. Not to mention, the questions she asks are extremely simple questions that if she spent a little bit of time she could figure it out by herself.\n\nThat’s not even the worst part. Sometimes she would just call me randomly without any heads up while I’m in the middle of work ; it even happened a few times after 5. Now, this person has a very thick accent so I have trouble understanding them sometimes. When I ask them to please rephrase the question they get extremely frustrated at me, as if it was my fault that I couldn’t understand their question. Sometimes she would VERY confidently say things that do not make any sense, and give the wrong instructions. When I try to correct them, instead of maybe apologizing for confusing and misleading people she would just try to blow it off easily like nothing happened. She’s very quick to accuse me when things seem off at work almost as if her purpose is to prove me wrong when she was the one that couldn’t understand the basic instructions.\n\nI have been working with this person for a few months now and am expected to keep on working with them. I really don’t know what to do about this. It’s almost as if she doesn’t know she’s being extremely difficult to work with. Everyone else on my team is so pleasant and nice, I would really hate to bring this up to my manager. \n\nAm I overreacting here and this is just what’s expected of work or should I do something about this ?

When I apply to 50 job offers, I willl receive like 4–5 answers within 2 weeks, and after the first interview, it's a plus week to get to the next step.

My dream has always been to work in a finance role in NYC, but given the timeline of my degree (leaving school during COVID-19 and reenrolling in the Spring 2023 semester), I unfortunately missed the application window to apply for most Wall Street finance-related internships. Instead, I took a sales internship (Fortune 100 company) in an unrelated industry this past summer to further develop my sales skills.\n\nKnowing that getting full-time entry level jobs at large firms in NYC (i.e. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, etc.) is a competitive process, and that having previous finance-related internship experience is highly beneficial, I have been taking steps to try to strengthen my application as a candidate. Prior to graduation, I had passed both the SIE and Series 66 exams. Currently, I am studying the Python programming language and working towards the MOS Excel Associate certification. For what its worth, I also consistently monitor the stock and futures markets, and read the WSJ daily. Given my previous sales experience, I feel that Sales & Trading or Asset Management would be the best paths to target to break into the industry, but I am open to other niches too such as FP&A. For context, my cumulative GPA is 3.43, which was influenced by some health issues prior to quitting school during COVID-19, but after I reenrolled for my final year I made the dean's list both semesters and earned a 4.0 term GPA in my final semester.\n\nI have applied to a couple of full-time positions based on Wall Street and have unfortunately been turned down. I am not ready to give up the fight just yet, and am just short of traveling to NYC to set up coffee chats/lunches with industry professionals to network and see if that could make a difference in the application process. Given my background, is it possible I can land a job on Wall Street, or would it be better to focus on less competitive companies/positions for my first finance job? Thank you for any advice you might have!",1akuivc,8,1707280321

I was wondering how hard it would be to make the move to Asset Management or a top consulting firm (not necessarily MBB).

539,Recent Graduate lost in this world,"I have just graduated last year from the University of Newcastle with a bachelor of business majoring in both leadership and management as well as international business. The first year of post graduate life I wanted to secure a simple job for the mean time whilst I look for my 'dream career' not only to build my job experience but also to obtain an income to survive. I started my post graduate life working at McDonald Jones Homes were I was a building and design consultant which has the least to do with my degree but nevertheless the pay was sufficient and the hours were suitable. The true job hunt ensued all whilst designing and drawing up peoples dream homes late at night in my three bedroom share house in which I dwelt. There was once a sense of wonder and whimsical childlike innocence that came with reading into these job descriptions and thinking what if, the jobs I was apply to at this time were truly in ever sense of the word 'dream jobs'. Alas, my efforts were in vein. Perhaps I was naïve regarding what I was capable of because I did not hear back from almost any of these jobs. It evident that I had to lower my expectations and be more realistic which is what I did as I started to apply to the next levels of jobs. I thought it might be as simple as putting in more effort into my cover letters. Thus, I spent hours upon hours writing what I thought of as magnificent works of literacy to engage employers and give me a chance of having a life that I wanted to live. \n\nI was having very little luck and felt tremendously lost as to why I had just done four years of university to be sitting in a very bare bones job I didn't particularly like ticking my time away, day by day as they roll together. I had soon learned of our Japanese office for McDonald Jones Homes and thought that would be a great place to start for my career in international business. We had a sales meeting coming up and I knew the CEO would be present, this was my chance. I prepared what I wished to say and had a aura of confidence that all would go well. Approaching the CEO of a rather large multinational company is much like going up the marble steps to meet with god but I was determined to change my life and make it one worth my time. I had him completely alone at the bar of the event, it felt although the time was right as if in this cosmic nightmare their was a sense of fate that had given me the perfect opportunity to say my peace. We hit it off to say the least as I started off with small talk and getting to know him as a person rather than a deity. He informed me of how he came to be in this role which rattled my brain a bit and put things into perspective on how the world works. He told me that he was friends with one of the directors and he's family had already established a small building company and it kind of just fell into his lap, he then went on to tell me of the importance of networking. I don't know if he was slightly intoxicated or if the forces of this world decided to give me a chance but I secured an interview with the head of corporate affairs the month after the conference but order of the CEO. I had my meeting with the head of corporate affairs which was a magical experience but he was quite shocked as to how I secured the meeting or why he was seeing me at all. He told me that we would stay in contact and the overall sense of the meeting was quite positive or so I thought. \n\nThe next week I had a meeting with my manager and he brought up the meeting and was very displeased that it ever occurred. He then proceeded to bring in the HR manager and they terminated my employment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am now in another role which is a bit more closely related to business but I am still apply to jobs. I really don't know to express my feelings, I feel cheated in all honesty. My question for you is what am I to do? how am I suppose to fulfil my yearning for working in the role in which I studied for such a substantial amount of my life? I'm quite lost with my life and feel although it is becoming to late to even keep trying (age 24).\n\nThanks for reading I hope your life is better than the one I currently reside within.

540,Should I (26M) apply for a job at the organisation my partner (25f) also works at?,"Hi everyone,\n\nJust seeking some advice for a situation that I (26M) find myself in (in Australia). \n\nMy partner (25f) and I have been in a relationship for abit over 2yrs and reside together. we both work in the same field and actually met at a previous job, where she worked before I joined the org. We began dating while working in the same office (on different teams) but didn't tell anyone and kept our in office relationship strictly professional (only speaking when needed and didn't sit together at lunch etc). Eventually I moved to a new office (same org) and then eventually my partner got a new job at a new org. \n\nMoving to now - my partner has been at the new org for about 14 months. They have recently had a position come up that I believe I am well suited to, and am considering applying as it is a step into a leadership role for me. The position does not really relate to my partners role but seems to have some overlap (very very minimal by my partners experience). \n\nI just wanted to get some advice on if I should apply for this job, what I should consider when I do, and if it gets to that point - when should I mention to the org that my partner works there? Any other advice is appreciated also!\n\nMy partner and I have spoken about my possible application and we are both in agreeance that we are okay if this was to occur.\n\nI've tried to provide all relevant details but I'll try to reply to comments as necessary but don't want to provide too much personal detail either.",1al0ly1,0,1707304453
541,Lost all passion; unsure if I should head down this path,"I'm uncertain if this is the right sub but I thought it prudent to seek advice from people currently studying finance/working in the industry on if I should continue pursuing this path. \n\nI'm 19 (soon 20) and live in Sweden, for years I've had plans of becoming an IB, breaking into PE or becoming an accountant if I failed getting into aforementioned positions. Over time however I've lost interest in investing, investment banking, fund management and accounting; in short I have no desire at all for finance related subjects anymore. Due to getting burnt out from constantly  trying to achieve top grades in school, failing to get accepted into SSE and the overwhelming amount of stress with managing the books for multiple businesses I've grown so sick of this subject matter and have even started resenting some parts.\n\nI also want to contribute to making the world a better place, to have a proper purpose and I've gotten the sense that there's more efficient ways of achieving that than through the world of finance. As a result I've gravitated to political science and studying how governments work with the hope of changing the cultural and political landscape. \n\nHowever deciding to choose politics over finance doesn't sound like a smart move and my own family very much expects I'm going into finance. It just seems like career suicide before actually involving myself in any industry. My question is then if I should continue pursuing finance because of career prospects even if there's no passion left and I actively despise some parts?\n\nTLDR; I have no passion left for finance due to personal reasons and don't know if I should pursue a career in it despite hating some parts.",1akxte4,4,1707292269

I was recently employed at a large financial services brokerage and was doing quite well. A large part of my role was obtaining my SIE license and my series 7 license. I got my SIE license very easily on the first try, however I failed my series 7 license largely due to the fact  a great deal of the studying was occurring over the holidays and I lost a lot of days to the holidays.

547,Put in resignation and now employer is reducing hours and is moving up the stipulated last day [PA],"In Pennsylvania. My employment contract stipulates 60 day notice which I gave and have my next job lined up. At first, employer asked me to stay longer for the transition but I declined as I already signed the next contract. 30 days after I gave notice, they've been reducing my schedule and telling me I don't need to come in. They found my replacement and now want my last day to be today. This leaves 3 weeks before my next job is ready for me. I've already asked my new job if I can start earlier and they are working on confirmation but if it's not possible, how can I protect myself in the meantime? I was not expecting to not get compensated for the next 3 weeks. The conversation with my current boss about this ended with 'let me follow up with you after my meeting and you talk to your new employer if you can start sooner' but then HR had me do the exit survey so honestly I don't even know if I'm currently employed or not. Is accepting doing the exit survey accepting the new end date? Per the contract they also need to give me 60 day notice unless I'm fired so would this be breach of contract? Is this enough for constructive dismissal to file for unemployment? Do I demand they either fire me or pay me out of the contract? There's thousands of dollars of pay on the line so I don't really want to just accept the loss as a life lesson and exit silently. I've never experienced this in previous job transitions before and I feel like I'm just getting walked over because I don't know any better just so they can save money by not having to pay me.

I plan on keeping some of the stuff from my end of college resume (my industry internship and a sales job I had during my junior year). \n\nShould I keep info like my Major/Minor, graduation date, GPA (3.35) and university?\n\nI was also in Gamma Iota Sigma which is a professional society for Risk Management, Insurance, and Actuarial Science. I'm currently in the industry that business frat is for, but I didn't do much and I'm no longer a member. Should I keep this?\n\nI think I will be fine if I can get an interview. I typically interview well and I've done really well at my current job the last 1-2 years and can really talk to that/show it on my resume.

578,Boss keeps rewriting my work,"I work in finance and part of my job is writing financial disclosures about our company. My boss is always rewriting my work even though I believe what I’ve written is completely acceptable and quality work. To preface our relationship, he seems to never take my input unless another coworker also agrees with me. For example, we have 1:1 calls where I will make a suggestion and he’ll say “no it’s fine the way it is” or give some other reason. Later in a group setting, his boss or another coworker (lateral to him) will make the same suggestion as me and he’ll make the change for them. \n\nThe most recent interaction was that I wrote new a paragraph in our financials and asked him to review. He messaged me each sentence one by one, changing what I wrote. I told him I would make all of those changes except for the last one bc I thought what I wrote added value. He pauses…types…pauses…types (we work remote)and he’s not used to me standing my ground. He finally says “ok we will leave it in but let’s ask Sam to review. People like the less is more approach around here.” Sam reviews and says it looks good. My boss is not happy with this - he then highlights the section and sends it to Sam again and says “this isn’t really necessary is it??”. Sam says that he doesn’t mind it either way, so feel free to delete if you want. My boss deletes it.\n\nJust to add a little to my credibility (because I’m sure you might be wondering if my writing just sucks) - last week, my boss was out for the day and I was asked to draft several sections. All reviewers (my boss’ boss and directors lateral to him) said it was great and made no edits to my work. \n\nWe do upward reviews at our company that are taken fairly seriously.

581,Blind 20-something looking to change careers into massage therapy,"I am in my mid 20s and going blind from a disease that was never fully treated when I was a child. With some certainty, by the time I'm 30 I will be fully blind and need to find a solid career.\n\nI have a degree in political science, and have previously worked in various aspects of the hospitality industry (sous chef, dishpit, back office work), but rarely has it led to any upward mobility of decent salary. The largest salary I've ever taken home is 30k/yr. I  now live in a resort town, am living with my parents, and I am considering going into massage therapy as a career change. I know that it is largely self-employment, client-driven.. but I figure it could provide for better wages and more relative security in the event I do go fully blind. It's a job I can do even without sight, with some easy accomodations I could accomplish administrative tasks.. and with it being a resort town, there are likely to be a good stream of clients. Maybe I could work at some hotel chain in Europe, since I have dual citizenship to an EU member state?\n\nMy main questions are whether the money in relative to schooling would equate to money-out in salary or potential income.. is my theory accurate? Currently, I have 30k in student loans, and would need around 6k more of debt to go for a certification at the local trade school. I believe it would take 6 months to a year to complete the training programme, not sure if I'd be able to work during that time. Would I be able to realistically make enough to pay off both debts?

We’ve only been around seven years and we’re constantly growing but typically we’ve always staff projects as: \n\n- project lead (which would either be our President, VP, or me)\n\n- project analyst (one of the two analysts or me if I’m paired with president or vp)\n\nIn the past, this has worked because it’s usually just been me as the only analyst, but as we’ve grown, I’m finding that the structure leads to really uneven workload, and makes it more difficult to develop the analysts. \n\nSince becoming manager, I’ve found this to continually be an issue, especially when we have analysts paired up on certain projects with VP or president, which understandably causes them to prioritize (or hide behind) those projects, rather than what I need or am directing them to do. \n \nTo combat this I’m considering switching over our structure to a  “studio” model so that I have more oversight and control over the analyst day-to-day work, and to ensure a more equitable distribution of work.\n\nMy worry about doing this is that it may lead to less ownership of work, since it all goes through the studio, and because it takes away potential development opportunities for the analyst, who would normally be working on that project, since we would have more of a collaborative approach. my plan to combat that is to keep the two main structure on project staffing and have the analyst be the studio lead for that project so that they are freed up to do more client facing work and put more energy and focus into the client facing work since they would have the confidence and support of the studio to assist them in analysis and deck work. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with this kind of structure? or experience in similar sized firms that could give some insight on how they structure their teams?",1akpqfw,5,1707266248

590,Networking to get a promotion / Playing the “corporate game”,"I’m 36/m and have worked for large corporations almost my entire professional career.  In every stage of my career, I’ve always been lauded by my managers/supervisors for the quality of my work, my work ethic and the results I produce.  However, pretty much every promotion I’ve gotten was essentially because I forced a managers hand, either by giving 2 weeks notice and then getting a counter offer that resulted in a promotion and salary increase, or by applying to a higher level role on another team that either resulted in me taking that role, or getting a promotion within my current team because a manager didn’t want to lose me.  \n\nThis path has been tumultuous at times, but I can’t argue with the results - I’m now making over 6 figures and I currently have pretty good job security as well as plenty of fallback options if things went south for me.  All this to say, I don’t have much to complain about.\n\nI recently jumped ship to a new company and am coming up on 2 years here.  The role I hired into at this company is one that I was on paper over qualified for, but the company offered me a salary number that my previous employer couldn’t come close to matching and this role offered better work/life balance so I took it.  After working here for 2 years though, it’s clear (at least to me) that I should be in a higher role and I’ve brought this topic up with my manager.  \n\nIn my current company, promotions have to be “signed off” on by at least 2 managers in my division that are 1 level above my manager.  Essentially this means they have to know who I am and/or the work that I do.  Without going too deep into it, my team is somewhat of a niche team that our higher level leadership doesn’t keep too close of a pulse on, so they don’t see a lot of what I or any of my teammates produce or do because of the way our division is structured.\n\nMy manager knows this and is recommending I “network” with those skip level leaders more so they get to know me better, and thus would be more inclined to approve my promotion.  To be honest (and this is the crux of my post), the thought of that feels so contrived and fake and really bugs me.  I’ve always been someone who lets my work speak for itself, and I’ve never been one to rub elbows with senior leaders just to get a promotion.  The thought of doing this just makes me cringe inside.\n\nOn the flip side though, I feel if I want to continue to move up in my career, I’m going to have to eventually bite the bullet and play the “corporate game” to make connections, etc.  What’s somewhat holding me up on that though is that I felt I built good connections in my last company (I was on first name basis with the CEO) and that got me nowhere.\n\nSo - as a mid-30’s professional, do I suck it up and shmooze with the higher ups, or go find another employer who values me on my work, rather than who knows me?",1akw97e,1,1707286107

592,23-year-old with Series 7 & 66 feeling lost and looking for career advice,"Hi all, I am a soon-to-be 24 year-old looking for career advice because I honestly feel stuck and am not sure what to do. I have a B.S. in Finance and got a desk job soon out of college with a financial firm. While working there for quite low pay, I passed my SIE, Series 7, Series 66, and state insurance exams. I was stuck working the desk job for 18 months before getting hired by a team within the company for a Client Associate role; however, I have stayed part-time on the desk job as the company needs someone to fill that role and did not hire anyone to do so. As a result, I have been doing this part-time split for 4 months. I am now earning $53,000 base with $6,000 from my team, which I feel overall is low, but I may be wrong here. \n\nThroughout my time at the company, I have expressed my eagerness to learn and move on from my desk role but have not been accommodated. I have not had a mentor and feel I have not been effectively taught how I can succeed at my role. Every inquiry I have had has been met by reluctance from leadership such as my current desire to begin studying for the CFP and their reluctance to pay for any part of it. I feel stuck with my current role. My desk is away from the others on my team, on top of the entirely separate location I work at half the time for my desk role.

Should I start looking for other opportunities (if so, I'm not sure where to apply or what to look for)? Do I give an ultimatum at my current company with no leverage?

598,"What is more relevant, a general ed degree in IT or several big relevant certifications?","I just landed a big IT sales role and I love it.  The company I'm with is in 50 countries and the possibilities will be near limitless. They have over 200 products and services and if I make friends and do this right I'll have a lot of options. But I want to set myself up for the future and not remain stagnant in my career and personal development.  I'm 38, have a degree in Econ and three IT certs (SAAC02, CCP, and AZ-900).\n\nFirst, the degree in Econ should be an IT degree but my life was going a different direction in 2013.  Second, I love sales. I'm good at it. I'm open and direct (with tact when need be), I make fast friends, I love building new relationships and I'm not afraid to ask uncomfortable questions about budget and timelines to move a sale along. (relevant later) My background consists of sales and customer service roles back since forever. I've worked commissioned W2 roles as a sales rep, as a server and more recently bartending after I got myself a bartending cert.  To get to where I am now I've applied to thousands of IT related jobs for the last 2.5 years. This was my dream job as of 2.5 years ago.\n\nWhat's the problem then?  Well, now, goals are changing. I want to give myself a better shot in 1.5 - 2 years at being able to take on more responsibility or to get away from sales altogether and move into back end roles. Back end roles would allow me to work remote and work remote digitally in LATAM (a big goal of mine for 2025).\n\nI like the idea of designing solutions and I can see myself working closely with the sales team as a Solutions Architect having that sales experience to guide those interactions. Pre-sales engineer. Something to leverage my background in customer service and sales where I'm still working with clients but without the commission piece and in a more technical way.\n\nThen, there's the other direction where I could see myself moving into a dedicated account management role or specialize in a particular area (IT Security) and become a specialist and work as an Overlay with the sales team. So many possibilities.  And that's the thing, it makes me think a general ed degree in 'Information Technology' could be relevant because it could lead to a Masters later.\n\nBut, some certs look really good on a resume. My SAAC02 has gotten me so many interviews and the next one I want is the COMPTIA Security+.  Maybe work for the state department when I get dual citizenship in Colombia (something I'm looking at seriously).  Maybe even a PMP and work as a consultant for myself in the future. Who knows. The point is, I want to give myself as many options in the future as I can.\n\nFinally, there's a community college near me that offers classes geared towards passing some of these relevant exams [(NoVA)](https://www.nvcc.edu/academics/workforce/index.html).  I've decided I will only pursue one of these paths in 2024 because I won't be able to manage both with what my schedule is going to look like when I get ramped up.  Honestly though?  I think credits would serve me the best in the future because I could work towards a master's later.  But certs could help me move into a specialty without having to work towards a Master's (much faster). Maybe companies like AWS and Google want to see degrees instead of certs? There's a lot to consider.\n\nTLDR: I know this was a lot, but, basically.... the title without the story.",1akrfyw,2,1707271069
599,Need Career Advice,"24M. Been depressed lately. I live in NY still at home with my parents, bachelors in business marketing. I currently have an office job that I've had for about 5 years now and has a lot of pros. My coworkers even joke that they will never give it up. And outsiders joke that they can't wait for me to leave so they can take my spot. It is a very easy office job, 5 minute commute from my house, work with friends/family, make decent money, paid vacation/PTO, 401K match, bonus, whole nine yards and we all look out for each other. Problem is although I'd hate leaving, this is pretty much a dead end job for atleast the near future and I am only making about 50k so I cant really financially support myself on my own with just this. This has led me to start considering other career options but I have had no luck finding anything marketing related.  \n\nNow today, I got a legit offer from a friend working a supervisory role at a medical facility in Florida making roughly the same wage. Now although it is the same wage, this would be a huge boost for me in terms of resume and growth oppurtunity. I have also considered pursuing going back to school for something medical related, so this would help me make that decision. Fortunately, he told me I can stay with him, save my money until I can get something of my own so I wouldn't really have to worry about the the financial aspect. But as an introvert, who feels comfortable at home, it would kind of be a tough transition for me and I would feel like a burden. \n\nBut heres where I'm torn. I have lived in NY my whole life and went to local community college so I've never even been away from home for more than just a couple of vacation days. One part of me says I am 24 with no wife/girlfriend this is my oppurtunity to get up and make a move although that would mean leaving my parents, brother, sister, grandparents, nieces, etc. It eats me up feeling like I just been stagnant and still do not have a career, just watching the time go by. This can be a major career oppurtunity but also help me grow up. I'd just hate to leave, regret it in 6 months and now I lost my office job. \n\nWould love some feedback and advice on this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",1akvosu,1,1707284138

604,[NY] I’m anxiety ridden over an awkward comment I made at work…,I (32F) am so stressed about this moment that happened 2 weeks ago it keeps playing in my head over and over and I’m worried I’m getting canned. \n\nI work remotely from home for a huge global company that’s based in the city. I had to go for a meeting and got chatting to this woman (external candidate). I’m an awkward and anxious person…it makes me try too hard and just fail. Long story short she told me she was from Puerto Rico and the only thing I could come up with was that my DOG was from PR. She looked at me funny and I said I rescued her from a partner org since it’s a territory and all and that it’s beautiful and she said “oh yeah I mean it’s poor” and now I can’t stop thinking she is going to complain about me to HR and I’ll get fired. \n\nCan someone please provide some insights here?? It’s eating away at me….,1akkhzi,4,1707253244

606,[WI] Why all the latenight and weekend rejection emails?,"*WI tag to follow sub rules but the question applies anywhere in the US and perhaps globally.*\n\nWhy are companies talent acquisition folks setting up their ATS to send the boilerplate job application rejection emails in the middle of the night and weekends?

I just figured the first several rejection emails that I received late at night (one on Thanksgiving!) or Sunday were sent by over burdened recruiters working late, but there's been too many, possibly even the majority.  It has to be intentional.\n\nIs this like a cooling off period for angry, rejected job seekers or something?

607,Comp Sci graduate with decent experience but unable to secure a job,"Hi all,\n\nSo I’ll try to be brief, I graduated from a good uni in Canada in June 2023. During my time at uni, despite there being a pandemic I was able to work internships. One was for a support analyst role and one for software engineer. I have a total of about 16-20 months of relevant IT experience in good reputable companies. However I’m still struggling to find a full time/contract position after graduating. I tapped into my network and applied to some positions through referrals but still no luck. I even asked some of the senior engineers who I worked with to review my resume and they said it’s pretty solid. I have applied to over 300 jobs but not a single interview call. I am so shocked that I’m struggling so much to land a job despite having good experience for an entry level role. I am so stumped as to why I’m not seeing any success or even slow progress. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on what might be the reason for this?

609,Confused on which career path to take,"I have about a year left of school before I go to college. I'm torn between two totally different career paths. \n\nThe first one is to become an esthetician (skincare specialist). I love skincare and think it would be fun to have that as a job. There is a college half an hour from my house that has that program. It would save me money if I lived at home while going to college. It is also close to home and I can stay with my family and not get homesick. \n\nThe second one is to become an ultrasound technician. I would get to see what a baby looks like in fetal development. The job would pay more than being an esthetician, but it would take longer too. Another problem with this is that the only colleges in my state that offer this program are 3 hrs away from home. \n\nI still have a year to think about this but wasn't sure if anyone could give me advice on how to figure this out.",1akux1l,1,1707281564

I've become that person to my boss.\n\nSome context: I work at a small startup where I'm a mid-level employee. We had a product launch a few months ago that was very stressful on everyone but it went well. During that time, the CEO and I had some public arguments about product strategy.

617,Company pushing me towards “easier” role. Help :’),"Okay so… I have been at this job for about a year and a half. It’s a start up and I really love the company and what we do. I went to school for cs and we do research. Admittedly I’ve been struggling because a lot of statistics is required and my foundation in stats is not the best, but I want to get better because I’d like to work in machine learning/Ai.  On top of that I started working from home a few months ago so I could move in with my long distance partner(they were very kind to allow this as I know it wasn’t ideal).  Wfh made things a bit more difficult for me… I had to figure out how to communicate online with my coworkers which proved rather difficult, had the stress of leaving home and being somewhere without my family as a support system, learning to focus while working from home(adhd does not help), and going into winter with seasonal depression starting it all just piled up and I was struggling with my work.\nRecently I’ve been taking a break with the research to help create a database and api for the company. It’s been a nice breather as I was stressing a bit with the research and with the breather I wanted to do some independent learning for stats so I could come back after the project a bit more sure of myself and better able to work.\n\nMy boss just told me they want to offer me a new position as a ‘data curator’. Which other coworkers supported me getting. This would be a full time position and I believe also mean I would no longer do research. \nThe thing is while I like the database work, looking at the description they gave me as well as online… I’m not sure it’s what I want.  While the role is necessary, I feel like they’re offering me this role because they don’t want me to go back to the research side of things, but they like me as an employee and want to keep me on.  Looking online at the average salaries of the two roles there is a definite pay cut for the new role. Which even though I don’t think would cut my current salary I think could affect future raises.  Then also if I wanted to leave the company at any point my experience wouldn’t be toward the kind of job I’m looking for. \n\nI’m kind of freaking out because I don’t know how to talk about all of this with them. How I can go about turning it down if I wanted, and if I did what that would mean for my position…\n\nEdit:  thank you everyone for the brutally honest (but necessary) input. I do think I’ll just have to take the position. \nI did want to clarify that some of my struggles were getting people to respond to my questions on slack and just having limited people to reach out to as it is a start up and everyone is busy. Also lacking some direction on goals and just needing a bit more guidance. \nI’ve definitely reflected on my wfh ability a bit ago and have been working on creating a routine that helps me complete my work. It’s not perfect but getting better. ",1akg19z,5,1707242487
618,[AZ] Forced Resignation Letter questions,"The company that I have worked for operates like two very different people squeezed under one umbrella. They have the same company name, the same CEO and upper management, and occupy some of the same buildings albeit in different floors. However, these two very different departments are like 99.9% isolated from each other in every other way. They serve two completely different populations, they are funded by two completely different sources (say, insurance versus contracts/grant funding with the state), etc. The half of the company I work for is closing down completely due to problems with financial insolvency and basically in inability to retain enough staff to make enough money through the healthcare-adjacent services we provide.  \nNow... I feel like all of my preliminary research of course suggests to definitely NOT submit a resignation letter, but in my specific case another company is essentially offering to absorb our clients and employees and the current company is telling us in that in order to accept a position at the new company (which they helped to arrange) we have to submit a letter of resignation. The other tricky part is that the old company wants to create a new position for me that is PRN (as needed) to be paid at my hourly rate, but it would be at most 2-3 hours a week and there's no 100% guarantee they'd need my services beyond the next month, so it is in no way comparable to my current pay and duties. If I wasn't wanting to maintain that relationship with them (not because I need the money but because I enjoy the very niche task/work and would like to continue doing it both for fun and job experience) I would just say 'fuck it' and not send over anything.  \nIt may be a moot point to worry about it or try to fight it since my current job will end this Friday and the new one will start on Monday. I assume if for some reason I got let go from the new job even if it was within the normal probationary period that I wouldn't still be eligible to claim unemployment from the old job. However, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to resign as if I had any choice in the matter.  \nIf I comply with their request I would be ignoring their suggested template letter for that reason. If I then submit an alternate letter that essentially just states ' due to the planned closure of this half of the company and subsequent elimination of my position I understand that my last day will be 2/9' would that screw me over in any meaningful way? Is there a better way to word a letter to make it clear for documentation purposes that I'm not resigning of my free will, without essentially alienating the old company?",1akqmss,0,1707268789
619,[WA] How to talk about resignation in lieu of termination in an interview,"I was given the choice of immediate termination or resignation in lieu with a 2 week notice. I took the latter option.

I inquired about the issue before it was a problem and was told it was in hand and not to worry. When it wasn't resolved, I was terminated for not asking about it again later. How do I talk about why I am no longer at the company without compromising myself, when my termination was not an idication of my contribution to the company? I want to be transaparent and not deceive prospective employers, but also don't want to overshare and potentially disqualify myself from an opportunity due to misperceptions. Any advice?

620,Mind going in Circles,"I have a comfortable position where I managed a 25% pay increase over my last job when I started 4 years ago, plus 11% in raises so far and they let me do a side business that brought in 84% of my salary last calendar year. I wasn't looking for a job, but one of my side gig customers asked what it would take to get me in the door and I told them a 26% pay bump over my W2 job which would account for my after tax, after expense business income plus my salary. So now I have an offer of around 150k with generous 401k match and bonus potential where my current job has none, all to work from home 24/7, working 45 hours a week compared to the 70 hours a week I'm working now.

I'm a little burnt out after 3 years of working 70 hours a week and meeting deadlines. Most of what we do with the money from my business is give to charitable causes so I'm a little remiss to leave it behind as well, but this job offer seems like too much to pass up and I am SO BORED and underutilized at my current role... \n\nI have some inside information that I got a whole department raises by requesting what I did so even if I don't take it I did something good.

621,"[NY] Accused of sexual harassment by hotel staff during a business trip, how to handle this?","A few of my colleagues and I were flown out for a business trip. During one of the days, I had an interaction with a housekeeping staff that I thought was just run of the mill, but to my shock & surprise it got reported to hotel security as sexual harassment and then my employer was alerted about it the following day. In the hotel's report, apparently it mentions something about indecent exposure and asking for sexual favors but I never said or did any of that and I don't know why that's being said about me. It's just insane that anyone can claim anything without proof and then someone's life and reputation gets negatively impacted because of it. I had a meeting with HR and they asked for my statement and compared it to what was being reported by the hotel management. Is the housekeeping staff just seeking financial gains from this? I told them that this has got to be a huge misunderstanding.\n\nThe HR department for my employer took action immediately after they were alerted and sent me home based off the hotel's incident report. I was so gutted and frustrated since I don't think I did anything wrong and it doesn't seem like there is any evidence to prove the accusations against me. I had asked my colleagues to check the hotel floors for any cameras to see if any footage could possibly be pulled to prove my innocence, but was informed that the hotel had no cameras whatsoever in the hallways of the guest floors. As for witnesses, I don't recall anyone else walking the floor while I was speaking with the housekeeping person. So at this point, it seems more like a she said / he said scenario?\n\nWhat are the possible outcomes here? I believe my employment is considered 'at-will' but can my employer actually terminate me based on false accusations with no solid evidence? Is there anything more I can do to disprove those allegations?",1ajyrz5,66,1707185942

So in customer's interactions, I have usually relied on building more genuine relationships with them, tried to really listen rather than forcing a sale and such. Things used to come naturally thanks to dedication and transparency.\n\nHowever, the last time I changed job I came to an industry where the sales cycle is MUCH longer, so I am now not even bringing those contracts I was used to collect as proof that I was doing something I was, unexpectedly, good at.\n\nAnd now I feel like I'll never be your 'stereotypical' sales person and that maybe I am in the completely wrong path so maybe it's not just the long sales cycle, it's me!\n\nBut when I research other careers I could consider for a career change (I love studying, wouldn't have any problem in taking a new course if needed) I just can't find anything which I think I would like more.

There are less than 12 employees in the US and about remaining in the UK. \n\nI was hired about 3 years ago under an agreed job description, which I signed.  When I started and in my contract, it outlined I would report to a technical team manager based in the UK for daily tasks, but I would be assigned a US manager for HR related reasons. It was written I would sometimes be asked to do tasks from the US management, which I was ok with, as long as I was still considered a technical resource (as opposed to a sales resource).\n\nMy UK Technical manager left a few months after I joined, leaving me somewhat directionless. The US team took over all of my taskings and management.  \n\nFast forward: lots of internal organizational changes and personnel. I am now reporting to a Customer Relations manager that used to be my teammate. \n\nLast week I was given a new job description document (same title) that outlines tasks, responsibilities and minimum qualifications. Many of the tasks are the same as my original description, with more emphasis on the sales related tasks over the technical aspects. The qualifications portion states the job requires 3-5 years of experience in this role. I have over 15 even before joining this company. The technical tasks I have had very few assignments over the course of my employment, and they have been more customer/product management related.\n\nThanks for getting this far. \n\n My questions are, how should I respond to this? What can I reasonably request be changed to improve my future marketability in a technical field and to recognize my decade and a half experience?",1ako99d,1,1707262377

651,Is it worth even asking about a 50 cent raise to match my coworker?,"I work as a rehab aide at a physical therapy clinic, which is basically a job that most prospective PT students work before going to PT school. I've been here since May and have worked my way up to being the main aide and working the bulk of the hours. I make minimum wage which is $15 here. About 2 months ago we hired another aide. After a month and a half or so she ended up also taking on extra hours filling in at the front desk since we don't have a full time receptionist. The first 4 hours or so of her shift are meant to be at the front desk and then the rest is meant to be as an aide, but she often spends the whole 8 or so hours of her shift back there instead of helping the physical therapists. This dumps a lot of extra work on me as I often find myself helping with 3-4 patients at a time when she should be helping with 1 or 2.\n\nToday we were talking about a prospective full time receptionist for the front desk and mentioned how he kept asking about the pay. At one point in the conversation she mentioned that she was able to get $15.50 as her hourly wage when she was first hired as an aide. I make $15 so it's not much of a difference (if I work 28 hours then it's essentially an extra $14 a week). Its sort of just the principle of it.

Mission is good, I like the work. \n\nI started as a writer on one side of operations - about 12 months in the second consultant was let go and I assumed her duties (same hours, same pay, but manageable). \n\nThis past fall the ED stepped down and the wheels are starting to come off. New ED was an employee already and took the role, but her old role was not replaced. As such, a lot of the ED duties are not being done. Randomly, they are falling on me. To further complicate matters I am reporting to someone new (I used to report to former ED and now I report to a different department head, not the new ED). \n\nNo one seems to know what is going on and my scope creep is IMMENSE.

Let me preface this by saying I know the industry is cutthroat and I expect the hours to come, but what my MD is doing to our team is frankly ridiculous. This is my second workplace (first was also Big 4) and though the hours were still tough, my first place was nothing like this.\n\n My current MD gives clients estimated turnaround times that are impossible, even with us working the insane hours. My co-workers and I consistently work well into the night and early morning. Of course, when we run 'past deadlines' I'm always the one to catch the flak.

731,Dear consultants who have shifted fields/thinking of shifting. Why?,"Just wanted to know if there are people who want to shift fields after being consultants for some time.\n\nContext : Been in consulting for 8 months. Company offers consulting services to foundations, NGO, and corporates for their CSR. Essentially the impact sector.\nI joined here after working at an NGO (education space) for 2 years. I wanted to explore consulting opportunities in the education space and was working on something similar for ~4 months but got thrown under the bus by being allocated to the CSR wing..\n\nIt's no perks of corporates but all the headaches, stress, and excessive work hours. \n\n\nRant :\nThe corporate wing lead is AN ASS. 4 people have left the wing citing him as the primary reason of leaving. Primarily coz of his behaviour and his style of working which just adds on to the stress rather than relieving it. \nThis has led to me being put on 5 projects simultaneously with 0 prior knowledge of any processes or the how of things. I'm learning as I go. It's getting tough to cope up with tasks and just feels like an mediatory role between the client and partners, adding min to no value in the grand scheme of things.\nI am afraid of going to work and it's almost always on my mind. I'm feeling a bit lost and and often find myself questioning my capabilities. \n\nI see the consulting roadmap and don't think it's for me, especially the corporate wing. I do enjoy it in the foundations/non corporate wings.\n\nQuestion: \nSo, those who have made a switch from consulting because it wasn't their bread and butter. How and where?\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: \nFeel bogged by management under excessive work pressure, getting a mediocre salary and benefits as the company is primarily an impact consulting firm. Cannot focus on learning because tasks take up all the time. Those who have been in similar situations, how to get out of it?",1af96vn,2,1706675379
732,Getting put on a PIP but they have no knowledge I have a disability- what should I do?,"I'm a year and a half out of college and I work for a large, but noncompetitive, consulting firm. I was told today that they're preparing to put me on a PIP, noting my lack of consistency with time management. My boss repeatedly emphasized the quality of my work and my favor with the clients, but noted that I've turned in enough work products late that it's become a pattern. Which, fair. \n\nI was blindsided by this meeting. To be frank, I've spent my entire life being rewarded for handing things in late because they've been such high quality. I've been enabled so much throughout my life that I've even completely skipped academic assignments and gotten full credit. I know the working world doesn't work like this, and I've made efforts at improvement and am still continuously improving my organization. Getting one skill down, like filling in a timesheet everyday, takes months to drill into me and make routine. I explained this to my boss.\n\nWhat I didn't explain to my boss is that I have debilitating depression (and probably ADHD, though I've never gotten tested). It's the cause of my executive dysfunction to begin with, and being enabled only made the whole problem worse. It makes all aspects of my life function horribly. It's been even worse transitioning out of college, moving to a new city with no friends or support, and figuring out everything that goes along with that (finances, grocery shopping, keeping a whole apartment clean instead of just a dorm room). I know we're in an era of mental health openness, but I couldn't bring myself to explain to my boss in this meeting. I'm extremely independent and defensive, and admitting this vulnerability in an area of my life where I'm supposed to be succeeding is extremely humiliating to me. \n\nShould I tell them? I feel like I probably should've. I think I'm not fully in danger of getting fired because it's really not a quality or client complaint thing, but time management and organization. And they did pluck me out of college into a fully remote work environment with absolutely no mentorship, so there's bound to be a learning curve. I also don't anticipate handling this bigger, formal 'WE'RE PUTTING YOU ON A PIP' meeting very well, so any advice you have to offer on that front is more than welcomed. I'm *angry* as well as shamed, and I don't understand why no one held a series of targeted conversations with me *before* the PIP. \n\nThank you for any advice! ",1afr715,0,1706731541

I basically started saving for retirement when I started at MBB and have been able to save a ton of money (>$125k) due to frugal habits of being a grad student for so long. However, I still feel way behind compared to my peers (yes, comparison is the thief of joy).\n\nI realize I probably sound naïve but this is truly a one of kind job for an industry that is really growing and covers a many different sectors I'm interested in. It's also a non-profit which explains the pay decrease.  Like some of you have mentioned, I am worried it's going to take me a long time to get back to my current salary if I ever do but at least I am sure I'll be proud of the work I'm doing (again, probably sounding naïve). \n\nThere is a voice in my head saying 'wait it out longer' to find something with higher pay though.

I am a Senior Consultant now, and PM a few decent size state tech project implementations (our contracts are about $2-4M for the projects I manage). My VP has reached out to see if I would be interested in relocating. This would move me from the Pacific Northwest (Oregon) to a state of my choice from 10 options. Most are states I have had zero percent interest in ever considering. I haven’t gotten a final figure for relocation, but wondering what I should expect and/or insist on. Move would come with a promotion/raise. Current salary is $140k plus potential 15% bonus and other employee benefits. What is a common relocation package for this scenario? And also, if you could pick a state to move to which would it be: North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Nebraska.\n\nEdited to add: You all are really interested in the salary, which wasn’t the question. I gave my salary as a baseline to use to answer the question related to how much you would expect to be offered to relocate. Yes I’ve been in the INDUSTRY for 18 years. I started as an admin to a PM/owner of a very small, boutique firm. I worked with him closely until I branched off as a junior analyst, senior analyst, consultant, senior consultant, manager, and other various titles. I’ve been with five companies now, all in the same niche industry. As a PM, I can see other employees job classification number, which correlates to the salary range. I am more than happy with my level of compensation for the work that I do, and also based upon what I know others around me get paid, and what jobs they have and level of effort required to be successful. \n\nTo be clear - I don’t work for a Big 4. We aren’t a software developer. I don’t do System Integration. I work in consulting doing oversight of state IT projects. Think: implementation of a Medicare eligibility system, ERP, etc. I work for a firm that ensures risks can be identified and mitigated (oversight) by both the state side (our client), and their software vendor.

It has really made me question why I chose such a stressful, yet rewarding, career when others seem to find such satisfaction on a fraction of my income. Perhaps I'm looking at them with rose tinted glasses. \n\nI am close to the end of it now and although I feel I have gained a better perspective of what I like (and dislike) about my job, company, and myself, I am still feeling the lack of direction that I left with.\n\nI'm interested to hear from others who took a longer period of leave; how it perhaps changed their perspective, and what they ended up doing.",1adqjw9,122,1706517080

Right now my resume is both strong and weak: I've built and exited a business from the ground up, graduated at the top of my class from a top-20 MBA program, and provided plenty of value for companies over my 4 years as a consultant. However, I don't have a 'name brand' consultatancy on my resume and building a business doesn't always mean much to an HR recruiter. Anyone who's done it knows it's essentially a consulting engagement for yourself. Anyone who doesn't probably equates a $2M a year business to their mom's stained-glass hobby biz. \n\nTherefore, I'm considering the CAPM and PMP certs. Possibly Agile as well. My undergrad is in chemical engineering; as a consultant and business owner, I'd assume that I have the relevant background. \n\nWhat can I expect for the following:\n\n1) timeline if I devote 20 hours/week to studying? \n\n2) Exits or additional consulting opportunities that I don't currently have access to? \n\n3) range of pay for either full time or consultant roles? Last year, I billed out $1100/day and was employed 7 months. I'd like my utilization to be higher but I'm not enough of an SME in certain supply chain functions to get, say, a role sourcing components for a new gas-fired power plant. The discount for full time to contractor is roughly 30%, if anyone is thinking 'Hey, $1100 is a ton of $$$!'  \n\nThis sub is great and I'd appreciate any and all advice. Also, a shout-out to anyone struggling in the consulting industry right now. It's tough and 1/4 of my grad class has already been laid off. Hang in there; network as much as you can, try to learn new stuff, and just be positive. Opportunities will open up when you least expect it! ",1adyzmn,9,1706544813

I, along with my peers, are struggling with the motivation of our young talents and cadets who have joined us.\n\nWhat motivated us when we were younger was being thrown in the deep end, and crawling our way out of the problem.

Or if we are inclined, be genuine interested in our clients work, and hopefully build a relationship for our next role.\n\nWe are not seeing that burning desire with the last two hiring rounds of cadet (they are in their second year with the company and on their way to their next promotion).

760,Affraid of getting stuck with in a development stack,"So, about two years ago I decided to go for an IT career. \n\nI started taking courses and also started my graduation and learnt all the basics from web development and I really enjoyed it. \n\nAfter a few months, I found this job in a startup where I worked with backend development and there I had the opportunity to develop my skills and learn about software architecture, design patterns and other stuff that I enjoyed.\n\nSome time after that, I started to learn more about mobile development and I decided that I wanted to work with that and become a specialist in it. \n\nI then quit my job (bc I wouldn't get the opportunity of working with what I wanted and they couldn't offer me a good salary) and started studying for this change to happen.\n\nWhile studying, I was also working on personal projects, progressing in my graduation and I started looking for a job. \n\nI was really struggling with finding a new job (bc all of that difficulty that people with less experience have in finding a job with IT). After some months, I was tired and frustrated of searching and not getting any results.\n\nSo, I took a test and was approved to work in one of the largest banks in my country. I was initially happy because they pay really well, offer lots of benefits and have a good career progression program.\n\nLater on, I found out that, as well as all the main banking systems in the world, they rely mainly on their mainframe, which runs on Cobol.\n\nMy plan was to enter this bank, work a few years and get enough experience with a widely used development framework.\n\n I was hoping to work with any Web or Mobile application, because I really liked those areas and I decided that I would be satisfied to become a specialist in either one of these.\n\nUnfortunately, they designated me to work with mainframe. I got very upset when I heard that. That really wasn't on my career plans.\n\nFrom what I heard about working with cobol is that the specialists are getting old and there are not a lot of developers for this stack, so it pays well. And I also know that is a very safe position to be, since most part of the modern banking relies on these cobol mainframes.\n\nThese benefits didn't convince me to be more positive towards cobol. \n\nI genuinely don't have any problems with the language. The thing is just that I really developed a passion for web and mobile development and I'm 100% sure that this is what I want to do.\n\nI started to think about how this would impact my career and then I searched for help in the web.\n\nI got really concerned after I read that some people got 'stuck' in certain development stacks for years in their carrer because of the lack of innovation in their companies and also because the market scope of use of those technologies are very restricted to a few economic segments.\n\nI also read that apart from banking and insurances, there is not much things to do with cobol. But even if there was, it's just not what I want.\n\nI had a talk with my manager to check the possibilities of working with other development stacks. And I shared my concerns about working with cobol\n\nHe said that the major tasks demmands come from the mainframe, so most of the time I would be working with cobol. And therefore the use of web and mobile technology are more sporadic and depends on the increase of their demmands, which is not under his control.\n\nBecause of all that, I'm getting really worried about becoming some kind of 'involuntary specialist' in something that I don't want to do in the long run.\n\nLet's say I work there for 5y. From these 5y, I would spend about 4y just working with cobol. I would gain a lot of exp in something I don't want to do. And if I wanted to look for another job in development, I would be much more experienced in cobol than in my desired development stacks.\n\nThe problem gets worse when I remember I don't have much experience with mobile or web, which led me to all that struggle of trying to find a job. \n\nNot only that. In my country, the good job positions are very scarce and you are generally required to have a lot of experience to work in a decent company. As far as I'm concerned, the bank can't provide me with relevance exp for those roles.\n\nI already saw how Being unemployed sucks and how people disrespect and don't give a shit about you in that situation. Even those who were supposed to help you in these difficult times. I definitely don't want to go through this again.\n\nI'd really appreciate some advice.",18hvagz,1,1702512355

764,"In a unique situation, looking to advance my career as a Software Technical Analyst but feeling a little paralyzed by the options right now"," Hi, a few years ago I decided to change careers after having some negative experiences in the marketing/media world as an account exec. I earned a MET associate degree from my local CC and found employment as a Software Technical Analyst at a large engineering company. I like the job – I’m no stranger to having an assortment of roles and responsibilities. I mostly work support tasks – Atlassian/JIRA administration, project management stuff - data analysis, building excel spreadsheets, data management, building charts and presentation materials for management, other times I work on our existing tools (updating python scripts or using existing python scripts to write new ones), other times I am updating and releasing documentation. I’ve been in my role for 4ish years now and have gotten a few raises and one promotion in that time. I desperately want to build more skills outside of work that will be relevant to my job so I can advance my career.\n\nWork Situation: I like the company I’m at but I’m also not sure I want to stay there forever - especially if I am only limited to a Software Tech Analyst role for my entire career – I want to advance and make more money (crazy I know, right? /s). Management really wants me to become a software engineer because in the words of my managers “we can pay you a lot more and you have relevant experience working with us”, my employer also covers (most) educational opportunities so long as the program is approved, and I get a C or better in the class. This is great but I do have some hesitations – a few years ago I started a post-bacc CS program through the University of Colorado online – the first class (Intro to Programming) was incredibly easy for me (I guess thanks in part to my job experience) but the second (Data Structures) convinced me to drop the program after the first exam – I had been spending over 24 hours a week on assignments, felt like I wasn’t learning anything, and I really did not feel confident in the structure of the program going forward. I have heard good things about the Oregon State program but I still have a bad taste in my mouth so I’m not even sure I have the desire to become a Software Engineer anymore.\n\nI am also interested in Data Analytics and Cybersecurity - I have thought about potentially exploring those more – from what I’ve read there are existing pathways for those looking to change careers in those fields, this looks a little more realistic for me but I'm not the most aware on what those pathways are. I already have some experience in working with data from my original Strat Comm (PR/AD/Marketing) bachelor’s degree and in my current role as a tech analyst. I also have completed most of Google’s Data Analytics course.\n\nIdeally, from an educational standpoint, I’m looking into educational opportunities that I can try without having to start from the very beginning – starting another bachelor’s degree from the beginning at my age (late 20s) does not seem very feasible – I need free time to date and travel and have a life without losing my mind. From an Engineering standpoint, Physics and Calc aren’t my strongest subjects either so I am VERY reluctant to take those classes.\n\nSorry for all the info but I like details:\n\ntldr: I don’t know any Software Technical Analysts or Technical Analysts so if you have been in either of those roles then I would love to know how you advanced your career and the skills you invested in/think are important. If you have been in a situation like mine, I’d love to hear what you did. In general, I’m looking for any advice, experiences, and potential-resources I could use to build relevant skills or change careers. Trying to keep an open mind at this point so this post is a little ambiguous (sorry). If there is a better sub for this post please let me know. Thanks!",17tq9v4,1,1699813641

812,Seeking career help in finance/tech," I graduated from college in 2019.I was an international student studying economics with a passion of working in finance. I tried to get internships throughout my college semesters, and I got few offer letters but when the background check would come out that I needed visa sponsorship, the companies would deny the opportunity. After graduating, I was offered by Goldman Sachs a 1-year job contract as an assistant administrator for wealth management team. I was extremely happy. It was my only hope to continue living in the US and an opportunity to get into finance. Even though, I didn't know exactly which career path in finance. Unfortunately, the USCIS (immigration office) took longer than usual to process the case. I received my employment authorization after 6 months and they only waited 3 months for me. They really needed to fill the position. I was so desperate to secure a job. I had only 2 months left otherwise I had to return to my country. I got a job as door-to-door sales for Verizon. I sold Verizon products to businesses for 1 year. I definitely learned a lot from that job. In 2020 my employment card expired. I needed work visa, sponsorship but Covid hit. I overstayed my visa. In January of 2022 I got married with my boyfriend who I had been dating for 3 years. It's been 7 months I applied for Green Card. I hope I receive it soon. As I am waiting, I'm trying to study Excel and Python.\n\nI'm hoping to find other people in similar situation as me or others who were in my position and now, they're settled.\n\nWhich path of finance I should seek that will see my experience in sales as an asset?\n\nAny advice on what I should do to increase my chances of getting a job in finance/tech?",zdxd9z,1,1670306391

840,Accounting Career or Tech Career??,Hello everyone! \nI’m currently facing a huge dilemma on weather to go for a career in accounting or the tech industry. \n\nSome background: I’m in college in Ireland studying accounting I’m in my 3rd year out of 4 years of college and I’m on work placement in a mid sized accounting firm for 9 months and I’m enjoying it. \nPreviously I worked in my family business (130 employees) doing accounting and IT work. We have an outsourced IT company but I am also very involved in the IT work they do. \n\nMy goal was to become a charted accountant but now I’m thinking I would prefer a career in the tech industry. \n\nI would love a job implementing IT systems or ERP systems or something similar to that. I’ve done this type of work before and find it extremely interesting and enjoyable. \n\nI love learning about new technology and find it much more interesting than accounting. \n\nCould anyone give me some advice or opinions? And where do I start?,u9girm,1,1650639215

Im currently a senior in high school who wants to go into the tech industry and has narrowed down to 2 majors at a university I want to go to. I need help choosing which one is better, I either want to go into project management or software development, also BI is acceptable too. \n\nThere's two majors I am currently in flux about: Management information systems (MIS) and Math with a data science focus. They both have their pros and cons which I will list and I'm not sure which is more important in this day and age. Also these pros and cons are university specific.\n\nMIS: (starting career: business analyst)\n\nPROS:\nEasier classes (business school major)\n\nGuaranteed job after graduation, at least 65k starting salary in LCOL - MCOL city, can be 75k if i try hard to network\n\nAmazing networking opportunities, lots of industry connections.\n\nCan pivot into project management mid career, or be a scrum master with certs\n\nWill better my soft skills (am an introvert)\n\nHas programs for selling yourself that have 98% placement rate within 6 months of graduation, and will prep you for interviews and review resume\n\nCONS:\nSomewhat lacking on the technical side of things, not math heavy, (i enjoy math) however I have 6 free classes I can fill with calc 2, discrete math, lin alg, intro to programming, and DS&A.\n\nMuch harder time to get into junior dev positions\n\nNow, onto math - DS\n\nPROS:\nHEAVY on math (graph theory, discrete math, abstract algebra, 2 statistics classes and a probability class, multivariate statistics if I so choose, 2 data science and ML classes, advanced/numerical linear alg, math for computing, real analysis, calc 1-3)\n\nIn depth technical education and can stack lots of CS classes\n\nCONS:\nWon't prepare me for job interviews and resume advice\n\nNot as soft skill heavy\n\nNow this is a big one: no guaranteed job after graduation, im on my own to job hunt in this abysmal job market for junior developer positions which is a huge con, my prospects after graduation are unclear. Very anxious I wont get a job within 6 months, so I am gonna have to leetcode and network my ass off.\n\nNo business classes to give me an idea of how business works, which I believe is important.\n\nNOW, you may ask, how come I am not considering a straight CS degree? Well at the university I want to go to, their CS program is pretty subpar, and I heard the CS professors are absolutely abysmal and can barely speak english, which is why I am not really considering it.\n\nRight now, I am leaning towards MIS because it is just more secure job wise and I am really anxious about the job market and the state of the economy we are in, absolutely positively cannot fucking afford to pick the wrong major with rising rent and gas prices, dont want to end up homeless or on welfare.\n\nAlso, my city has more BI and IT positions open than dev jobs\n\nWhat do you guys think?",tcqojw,1,1647118642

It's a old guy who's been doing this for years and forgets I just started and don't know what im doing. Instead of training me ( you know, like they are supposed to) I get screamed and yelled at for not understanding everything right off the bat. This is usually followed by a lengthy tirade about 'back in my day when men really worked' and then more verbal abuse. I have been threatened with physical violence ( 'you keep fucking up I'll beat your ass' ) and some good old fashioned reminiscing like ' I remember when you could hit your apprentices, those where the good days'. \n\n  Overall, 2 years in and I'm sick of this super macho old school mentality and feel like my progress in regards to actually learning the trade is going nowhere. I'm curious if I just have a unique skill in finding crappy places to work or if others in the trades have experienced similar things.\n\nEdit: I'm truly overwhelmed by the response and it's good to know I'm not alone in this. Thank you everyone for the advice I will definitely try to see if this can be worked out.

This family vacation is already booked. My family and I discussed it and we think I should just tell her “I won’t be in these days. We talk about a work/life balance all the time and this is it.

Whether or not that's the case for you, I sincerely hope this resume format helps you find a better job than you had going into this mess. In addition to having [S&G help how we can](https://sheetsgiggles.com/blogs/news/s-gs-response-to-the-covid-19-crisis),  I'm going to do my best to answer Reddit PMs and emails that come in re: job hunting during April as people face this crisis. (Please at least edit your resume into my format below before asking me for a critique, as my first advice to anyone who hasn't will be to guide you to my format.) All my best to you and yours, and I hope you're all staying safe out there.\n\n**11/17/2018 last edit (psyche):** I'm working 16+ hour days as CEO of [Sheets & Giggles](https://sheetsgiggles.com) nowadays, so I unfortunately don't have time to reply to PMs (get about 10 a day still). So sorry! If you have more questions, please see [this follow-up thread with FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8hs6xc/part_deux_of_the_top_post_of_all_time_on_rjobs_im/) I did a couple months ago. Good luck everyone! - Colin at S&G\n\n---\n\n#Original Post:\n\nThere was a recent post on Reddit where someone was lamenting that they had sent out dozens of applications, but hadn't heard back from anyone. I commented and told them they probably had a bad resume format and to PM me with it so I could review it for them, and about 50 other redditors ended up sending me their resumes to review. I don't have time to do all of them, so I decided to write this post and share a [downloadable editable Word doc resume format](https://sheetsgiggles.com/template) in the hope that it fulfills my personal obligations (*note: delete the footer before sending out!*). Here's a [preview](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y5sHcAI) of the resume.\n\nI'll keep it short and sweet, and hopefully many of you find this useful.\n\n---\n\n*Source: This quick excerpt is from a longer [blog on my website](https://sheetsgiggles.com/blogs/news/sheets-and-giggles-fastest-growing-startup-in-colorado). My company ([Sheets & Giggles](https://sheetsgiggles.com)) makes sustainable eucalyptus bedding, so this is a little out there.*\n\n---\n\n**General resume advice:**\n\n* Use a professional-looking gmail, outlook, or personal domain email address. Delete your hotmail with extreme prejudice.\n\n* Don't put an objective section or summary. It'll be skipped, and it's space that can be used better.\n\n* Unless you have 20+ years' experience, make it 1 page. You can do it.\n\n* Don't put your full address. 'City, State' is enough.\n\n* Name your resume '\u200bFirstName LastName Resume' and that's it. Never submit it with '(Project Management)' or 'Final' or '2018' or literally anything else in the file name.\n\n* If emailing your resume, always submit it as a PDF, never as a Word doc. You never know how wonky a Word doc will look on someone else's machine. If uploading to an online application that uses resume parsing software, you can upload the Word doc as well or if it's required to do so.\n\n* Try to read it in 10 seconds or less and see what you take away from it. That's about the initial screen time before someone makes an initial up/down decision, so you'll want to examine it from that perspective.\n\n* Interests are important because it gives the interviewer something to connect with you on, and it makes you more than just a faceless resume. If you put Seinfeld, I promise someone will ask you what your favorite episode of Seinfeld is (mine's the Soup Nazi).\n\nThat's the most important stuff.

863,Disappointed after asking for a raise,"I have been with my company for almost 3 years and have not had one yearly review or raise.\n\nFor context, I work in a specialists medical office and I’ve worked in all positions from front desk to verifying insurances to rooming patients and translating. \nAt some point we were extremely short staffed and I (along with two other girls who are no longer with the company) busted my ass working multiple positions and overtime for this office. \nWhen I went on my maternity leave, I worked remotely for them to help catch up on work because they were severely understaffed, especially with me gone. \nAfter my maternity leave ended, I wound up in a position where I needed to move out of state. I ended up staying with the same company and continued working remotely verifying insurances which I am still doing now. \n\nRecently, we have had changes in staff and new management, but the partners and owners of the company have not changed. \nI decided to finally ask for a raise to $20/hr as I feel I’ve been a huge asset to the company and have gone above and beyond to prove my worth. \nI emailed my manager with a letter outlining all of my duties and accomplishments, and how I feel I’ve earned a pay raise especially after three years of never asking for anything. I asked her to please consider my value to the company and give me a raise that will better allow me to meet my financial obligations. \n\nAnd her response honestly feels like a spit in the face. I feel disappointed and honestly disrespected. I understand working remotely has its benefits, but for the amount of work I do, and by myself since I am the only person in the whole office in my position, I would have thought they’d realize how invaluable I am to the company. \n\nThe first screenshot is her response giving me two “options”. The second screenshot is my draft of a response/two week resignation notice.  \n\nI cannot continue working with this company and being undervalued and unappreciated. \nI have two other jobs lined up right now so I definitely have a plan, but I really wanted to stay in the position I’m in.\n\nDo you think my response is okay?

870,Quitting after 8 years without notice. Am I wrong?,"Best job becomes toxic\n\nI have been working for the same company for over 8 years as a lead developer.  I loved my job and I really enjoy working with most of my coworkers.  I was directly and indirectly responsible for a lot of significant website development and streamlining various processes for them.  Overall, this was a role that I had enjoyed, despite having to commute a total of 3 hours each day.\n\nTwo years ago, my daughter required surgery and the following day I fell and broke my arm.  I was late for an important meeting the next day.  I was issued a written warning and placed on a probationary period.  That should have been enough of a warning to me, but I put it behind me.\n\nFast forward to a Thursday night a few months ago.  My wife suffered a major heart attack.  I took her to the hospital, where she was placed in a medically induced coma, connected to a ventilator and had a pump inserted into a major artery to help relieve the workload on her heart, and had an angioplasty performed with 2 stents inserted.  I called my boss that night and told him what was happening and I would not be back in to work for the foreseeable future. I sent our entire group an update on Sunday.  Her condition was still critical and she was still comatose in the icu.  She remained that way in the ICU for a solid week.\n\nI emailed them again later that week with another update.  After the 8th day of missed work (sick and vacation days were used), my boss calls me and tells me that we need to have a meeting with HR that afternoon.  I was placed on another probationary period and written up yet again.  He told me that there comes a time where I just have to decide what is more important, my job or my wife.  I was to come back in the office, 5 days per week or I would be fired.\n\nThe HR lady suggested that I take FMLA leave, which I did.  I have heard that the manager talks about how projects will move forward once I am back in the office.  I intend to use every last PTO day I have left, then I will return my development laptop and quit.\n\nIn the interim, I was contacted by a recruiting agent that told me of a job opportunity only minutes away from where I live.  I interviewed with them a couple of times and they offered me the job.  The new company was more than willing to wait a couple of months for my wife to get through the bulk of her medical appointments before I started working there.  I will start there in just over a week from now.\n\nAm I wrong to not extend the professional courtesy of a two week notice here?  I feel that my employer did not care about my situation, so why should I care about a notice?\n\nPS: My wife is recovering and doing very well thus far.  Her outlook is good!",15vz3un,9878,1692498881
871,“We made a mistake on your job offer” - 20% pay cut after accepting and onboarding with giant company. Anything I can do?,So I recently signed a job offer with a giant company and once I looked at my actual salary in the system it did not match my offer letter. I pointed this out to the HR department (supported with evidence in my offer letter) and basically they said that they made a mistake and my compensation is 20% lower! I don’t think I have the money or the patience to sue a giant multinational corporation. Nor do I stand a chance. My supervisor just sort of acts like we are all at the mercy of HR and it’s not like HE made the mistake. Plus I still want to work for them! It’s a well paying job even after the 20% cut.

We use WhatsApp for work communication. I simply removed myself from the conversation. My boss is very toxic and I was not going to make my mental health worse over it.

882,Coworker snooped in my personal planner and reported me to HR,"Like the title suggests…. For background I’m currently in grad school because I want to work in education and get out of my current industry. So like many would guess, I’m pretty busy. With my 7-3 job, school work, and next term I’m fitting an internship in on the weekends at a local college. \n\nThe thing is, I haven’t told ANYONE that I’m even in school. The only people that knew-and were supposed to know, are my school, my fiancé and my therapist. So I found it kinda odd that my other coworker, let’s call her Joan sent me a Facebook message saying that HR is probably going to call me down because other coworker, let’s call her jackass reported me for “having outside employment without disclosure” and she apparently told everyone that I’m in school, and that I have an internship that starts soon, so I’m probably resigning and it’s “not fair to everyone else” even though my internship is on the weekends! …livid.\n\nI had no idea how she could have possibly got that information, as I don’t do anything school related at work, nor did I ever talk about it on the phone or anything like that where she could have overheard. Up until this point I think I’ve done a pretty good job at keeping work and school totally separate. Well, I guess not..\n\nIt took a while for me to realize that I had left my planner in the top drawer of my desk the other day which has all of my school, work, and very personal information in it, and jackass stays later than I do, so she’d have ample time to snoop her nosey ass through it and what ever else after hours. \n\nSo now, not only am I probably going to get fired for something that isn’t even my employers business, but now my coworkers have a ton of my private information/goals/aspirations, even my menstrual cycle from my planner. I feel violated, screwed, and like I’m a total idiot.\n\nMoral of the story: don’t ever trust that you’re coworkers don’t snoop through your private sh*t when you’re not there I guess.\n\nUPDATE: Outside work - I’m taking the keep quiet approach, HR hasn’t approached me about it so I’m not approaching them. It states in the handbook that college, volunteer work, unpaid internships and research projects DO NOT count as outside employment and do not require approval.\n\nMy planner - I’m still thinking about how I want to approach this issue. There are no cameras that can visualize my desk, so unfortunately it’s going to be difficult to prove.",15hgxv6,7208,1691098845
883,Reasons why this job market is horrible.,"1. **Skeleton Crews.** Basically, if one person is doing the work of three people with the same pay why hire more?  Who cares if that person is stressed out? Business is still running as usual and will hold out as long as they can. By not hiring more and keeping the headcount low, profit goes up and whoever is in the upper management gets a nice bonus.\n2. **False Hiring and PPP Loans.** Ranging from small businesses to large corporations, many have received Payment Protection Program (PPP) Loans that were supposed to be used for payroll and other expenses during the pandemic. However, many of the loans were abused and pocketed by owners and then later forgiven. A condition for these loans to be forgiven is if a company is 'actively' trying to hire but cannot fulfill these positions. That's why people are struggling to get interviews as well as seeing jobs being posted over and over again. They had no intention to hire in the first place. Basically, it was a huge money transfer and the top ate well.\n3. **Everyone is hiring.** No, they are not. Only retail and fast food positions that barely pay a living wage and high stressed are only hiring is what they mean. Not the comfy white-collar jobs with good benefits cause who would give that up? Even then, these places are running on skeleton crews as well.\n4. **Mass Layoffs.** You have now a lot of people including whom have more than 12+ years of experience looking for jobs now. A good chunk of them are willing to take lower-paying jobs because they have no choice but to put food on the table and pay bills. Now the entry-level or junior-level position you are applying for has become more competitive. Employers have the luxury to be picky and want a unicorn to be a yes man, a bootlicker, someone who does not talk back, who is overqualified, and willing to take a pay cut as well. Also, a lot of these companies have a 'monkey see monkey do' mentality. Once a couple of companies started doing layoffs, then other companies started doing it only because 'it must be the right thing to do right now'\n5. **The Feds actually want unemployment to go up.** They want it to go up because the justification is that no job = no money = reduction in savings = lower purchasing power = reduction in inflation. Higher interest rates would lead more people to hold off on purchases they do not need which put less money in circulation and bring down inflation according to the federal government. Also, Powell said it is to 'discipline labor' as well. But of course, there isn't a problem with corporations making record profits during high periods of inflation. It is estimated that 70% of inflation came from price gouging in which corporations raised the price more than they needed to and mask it as inflation. Anything but to tax the rich right? I'm sure trickle-down will happen anytime soon.\n6. **Anti- WFH Propaganda.** Throughout the pandemic, multiple reports proved that WFH has increased productivity and worker well-being that has not been seen pre-pandemic. WFH was positively received. But all of a sudden Return-to-Office was necessary as WFH wasn't working even though as long you have a computer, desk, and WI-FI, the same work that can be done at the office, can be done better from home in most people's cases. This is later revealed that a lot of bigger players are tied up in real-estate investment of these corporate buildings and that tax revenue around the surrounding areas has decreased as well which the local government does not like.  If you WFH, there is no need to buy food on the way to work or buy expensive lunch downtown, and then waste money on gas. However, with the big RTO push, a lot of employees are either resigning or outright refusing because why would you go backward on quality of life?  I even was disqualified from an interview for asking about remote policy but it is what it is. Remote work is in hot demand yet employers refuse to acknowledge it.\n\nThere's more to why the job market is trash right now of course but this is JMO from all the reports and posts I have been reading.

888,A Warning About Glassdoor,"**EDIT**: A little info from Glassdoor that I learned as part of my last job in marketing:\n\nThe most recent review left, regardless of its score, is weighted at 80%. This is why after a negative review is left, a company will routinely leave an onslaught of positive reviews to counterweight the negative one. Glassdoor is trash.\n\nAlso, some valuable nomenclature: an [*Active*](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/5-things-can-free-employer-account/) employer is one that uses the platform to respond to reviews and maybe some other trivial touchpoint engagement. An *Engaged* employer may be one that pays for the service. I'm inferring from the subtle threat in Glassdoor's own [content](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/opening-the-glassdoor-a-wise-move/).\n\n**EDIT 2**: Some people are pointing out that their algorithm had detected an identical review was submitted, which was the reason for my getting banned. Problem is, I didn't leave a second review. Like I said, the original review was live for 2 months and then it was removed for the reasons cited.\n\n**Original**: For the past few years, I've often defended Glassdoor as a useful resource as part of any job-seeker's overall job-seeking toolkit. \n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I interviewed with a company that had horrendous reviews. Literally, all 15 reviews were 1-star and for the same reasons. So in the interviews, I brought up some of the themes. The hiring manager, a decent man, admitted to all of it and said he was desperately and single-handedly trying to change those issues. So in this case, the negative reviews weren't a bunch of bitter employees; they were actual experiences and issues.\n\nI elected to join the company based on this honesty and the prospect of a challenge, and of course, it was exactly like how all those reviews had said it would be. It was awful. I was thankfully laid off due to COVID.\n\nAfter being laid off, I left a very detailed, thorough, cutting review that within a week of being posted, had 6 'helpful' upvotes or whatever. After two months, the review was removed suddenly for violating guidelines and so was every review I had ever written. Incredulous, I reached out to Glassdoor's content management team. They would not tell me exactly what the issue was, just that I was banned from participating in their community. Finally, a service manager emailed me to say they had some proprietary algorithm that had detected language that was in violation of Glassdoor's guidelines. To be clear, I didn't use any community guideline-violating language. Apparently, they detected an identical review had been written elsewhere.\n\n*I have a close family member that works for Glassdoor. I spoke to this person and found out that a very recent strategic repositioning for Glassdoor is that they are trying to become a PR company of sorts, so they are focusing on brand management for companies. As a result, they are getting very aggressive with negative review-takedowns while allowing very obviously fraudulent positive reviews to remain the same.*\n\nThis same company from which I was laid off, from June-August, posted 10 5-star reviews, each of which was of similar length, all with just about the same thing to say. Cliches like, 'great culture', 'build your skills', 'enlightened management', 'cool tech', 'takes care of employees'. I reached out to Glassdoor and asked them to use their 'proprietary algorithm' to see if there was any fraud in that content, to which they said no, there was no violation.\n\nSo, what I'm getting at: with Glassdoor's supposed strategic pivot to brand management, it is becoming even less reliable than it was before.",jbod57,6481,1602771395
889,I walked out of a job interview,"This happened about a year ago. I was a fresh computer science graduate looking for my first job out of university. I already had a years experience as I did a 'year in industry' in London. I'd just had an offer for a London based job at £44k but didn't really want to work in London again, applied hoping it was a remote role but it wasn't.\n\nAnyway, I see this job for a small company has been advertised for a while and decided to apply. In the next few days I get a phone call asking me to come in. When I pull into the small car park next to a few new build houses converted to offices, I pull up next to a gold plated BMW i8. Clearly the company is not doing badly.\n\nGo through the normal interview stuff for about 15mins then get asked the dreaded question 'what is your salary expectation?'. I fumble around trying to not give exact figures. The CEO hates this and very bluntly tells me to name a figure. I say £35k. He laughed. I'm a little confused as this is the number listed on the advert. He proceeded to give a lecture on how much recruitment agencies inflate the price and warp graduates brains to expect higher salaries. I clearly didn't know my worth and I would be lucky to get a job with that salary. I was a bit taken aback by this and didn't really know how to react.\nSo I ask how much he would be willing to pay me. After insulting my github portfolio saying I should only have working software on there he says £20k.\nAt this point I get up, shake his hand, thank him for the time and end the interview.\n\nI still get a formal offer in the form of a text message, minutes after me leaving.

Graduated from Virginia tech with a dual masters degree. I am by no means perfect by damn I can’t do nothing about my accent.\n\nI wish I haven’t seen that chat.

894,"BS’ed my way into a 160K job offer, am I crazy to turn it down?","So the best case scenario has happened, I find myself on the end of a job offer that will almost double my salary and it would change my life. \n\nI spent the last 2 weeks doing interviews for a job I applied to off a whim. The job itself wasn’t even the one I applied for, but the senior role above it is what the recruiter called me for. \n\nWhen we discussed salary, I thought I was being aggressive by saying my range was $115K-$135K/yr (I currently make $88K) only for the recruiter to say $135K is on the lowest end for this job.\n\nI was surprised, and encouraged by that to move forward. As I continued through multiple rounds of interviews I started to realize this job was a very advanced marketing position in an area I only have theoretical experience in or very little practical experience. \n\nSomehow, I was offered $160K plus a moving package (I’d move my whole family across the country) for a job that was basically asking me to build their marketing team and I really don’t think I can pull it off. \n\nMy wife fully believes in me, but taking on areas like paid ads, email marketing campaigns, SEO and more, when I’ve never done any of that seems daunting and that it’ll ultimately end up with me being fired at some point. \n\nThe job I currently have is fairly laidback with a hybrid schedule whereas this new one would require long hours and fulltime on-site. My current employer has been doing buyouts for over a year as we’re struggling in this economy so that’s why my random searches began a few months back. \n\nIs it crazy if I only try to use this offer for a raise? Or take a massive risk and move because it’s money I never thought I’d earn in my life? Even staying seems risky because of buyouts but I’m currently in talks with moving to a new role with my company for a good pay bump because there are so many open roles now that they need people in. \n\nTLDR: Tricked my way into a $160K job offer improving on my $88K job, current company is struggling with buyouts but will offer me a pay bump in a new position. I have little to no experience for the job offer, should I accept anyway?",16ay1o1,6254,1693943263

896,Just got my first 6 figure job offer! Just wanted to share with someone,"Hi everyone! I don't have too many people I can talk about this with, so I just wanted to share the news with someone. I work in software, and my current pay is $75k per year. The short version of my past few years is that I dropped out of college and have been making $45k/ year for a while pre-COVID. From there, 2020 hit me really hard. I was unemployed for about 6 months. I was looking for $18/hour jobs, then I got an opportunity in software sales. I started at a base salary of $50k per year. I got promoted once and then moved over to operations within my company, and my salary went up to $75k (where it is now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving been at my current company for 3 years, I've known that I was underpaid compared to the market for a while, so I started looking a few months ago. I applied to this job that's a manager-level position, which is one level above my current role. I had my final round interview at this company last week and it went pretty well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hiring manager set some time with me yesterday afternoon. When we hopped on the call, we talked for a few minutes before she offered me the job! $120k per year! In the moment, I didn't react much outwardly or inwardly beyond being pleasant and expressing thankfulness and excitement about the offer. I was trying to keep my hand close to my vest I suppose. I ended up thanking her and agreeing to follow up on Monday after I had the weekend to think about it (as I was in the process of a few other interviews as well). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the hour after we hopped off Zoom, I didn't feel much. Then the offer letter hit my inbox. Seeing $120,000 in black and white is when it hit me. $10,000/month. I broke down and started crying. That's more money than I've ever made before by a long shot. I wanted to call my dad and tell him because I know that he'd be proud. He died in 2020, so I got hit with a wave of emotions from excitement to relief, to grief hitting me super hard. I've had a lot of money stress over the past few years, and this feels like a game changer. I'm hoping that this will accelerate my ability to build up savings and I want to be smart with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's my ramble. Thanks for listening. Today I'm excited and am looking forward to accepting on Monday. I still wish I could call my dad up and tell him though; I know he'd be happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: wow, I appreciate all the love!

897,Absolutely sick of the return to office hit pieces,"Seriously, everyone needs to be fully aware of this. The majority of data does not support in office work vs remote work. Companies were the most profitable they have ever been during the pandemic. Yes, that was also caused by an endless supply of helicopter money, but also because worker engagement was up a ridiculous amount. For me personally, I have never worked as hard as I have during the last few years, and I am fully remote.\n\nThe REAL reason for all these stupid articles is the commercial real estate situation. Companies are losing money (on paper) because their real estate values have all declined. Forcing employees back to the office would create more demand for surrounding homes/businesses, and affectively raise their portfolio value.\n\nThe other reason is control. The C-Suites job is to 'inspire'. They don't feel a sense of purpose without having you, the worker bee, around for them to view. They want to see you building their pyramid for them, even if it can be done remotely and more efficiently. It's a psychological thing that sociopaths in the C-Suite need. They're losing control, and they want to have it back to be more valuable since their perceived value is about steering the ship and not contributing anything meaningful.\n\nJust wanted to share and vent because I'm sick of this narrative. Remember the truth and ALWAYS bring it up.\n\nEDIT: Wow...I didn't expect to get this many responses. I just wanted to add that yes, there is frustration in my voice. I'm tired. I'm tired of the constant squeeze corporations apply to all of us daily. It's always happened throughout history, but it is MUCH worse now. Profit over People has never been more rampant then it is now. \n\nThe truth is, I believe this country is in desperate need of a workers rights movement. I would LOVE to see every talented individual out there push back against this RTO narrative that is solely based off 'a gut feeling' from a handful of people. I'm just tired of being lied to, and it's a constant fight to keep the truth alive.\n\nAlso, to everyone that is saying things like 'suck it up and deal with it', you're part of the problem. That dismissive attitude means you aren't open to change, and just accept things the way they are. You can change anything you want in this world, you just have to get enough people to say 'No'.\n\nTake care",16ayf5l,5895,1693944105

905,"My boss confronted me about only working 7 hours and 45 minutes a day, what do I do?","\nHey all,\nToday, my boss called me into his office and confronted me about the fact that I take a 45 minute lunch when I should only be taking 30 minutes. I work in an engineering office and we can take as long a lunch as we want whenever we want, as long as we are working 8 hours a day. I get in at about 7:30 and leave at 4 everyday, which totals 8 hours and 30 minutes, and each day I take around 45 minutes to eat lunch. So technically I come 15 minutes short everyday. Some ask why I don’t just take an hour lunch like most of my coworkers, but I don’t need a full hour, so why would I want to leave later? I get all my work done on time or early, and I often find myself with no work to do. The whistleblower that told my boss about this is an older lady that can’t get her work done in 8 hours because she’s bad with computers. She was upset that I get to work after her and leave before her. My boss said we would discuss this tomorrow, and I don’t know what to say. Fact is, this whole situation is about office politics.

908,I found a remote job in 2 months using AI tools and a 3-stage preparation process,"I was laid off a few months ago (together with almost half the people in my company). I was a little bit in panic mode by then. During the first 2-3 months I applied to literally every single PM job offer I saw but I didn’t even pass the second interview. Then a friend explained to me the 3-stage process she used to find her job. She also recommended a few AI tools that ended up being very useful. \n\nAfter 2 months of following her guidelines, I was offered 2 positions! 1 of them with a higher salary than the one I had in my previous company (ironically I took the other one, but for different reasons).   \nI learned that finding a new job is a job in itself. You improve with practice and by failing. So the 3-stage process is designed to iterate fast. In every stage, I focused on “Mastering that stage only” and improving on 1 metric:\n\n**Stage 1 Iterate my Resume**\n\nMy main focus in this stage was to improve the conversion rate of my resume. The metric I used was the % of responses I received. I kept refining and tweaking my resume until I achieved a solid ratio. I started with less than a 5% response rate (from *resume sent* to *first interview scheduled*). \n\nIn a shell I did this:\n\n* Adapt my resume for every position (I used a few tools, mostly kickresume explained below).\n* When describing my previous experience, rephrase it using the exact key words used in the job offer. A lot of companies use software to filter resumes, so if they don’t find certain keywords, you are automatically rejected.\n* Create a cover letter “template” and leave some paragraphs to modify depending on each company.\n* I created a notion page with a more detailed resume, with links to previous projects and a lot of details about me. I added this when asked for a “Website URL” (asked in many offers).\n\nOnce I started getting first interviews with HR managers or hiring managers (1st interview), I shifted my attention to preparing and improving my interview skills.  \n\n\n**Stage 2 First interviews (usually with HR)**\n\nIn this stage, I aimed to increase the number of second interviews or technical exercises I was offered. This was a critical step in progressing further in the hiring process. I made sure to thoroughly prepare for these initial interviews, showcasing my skills and experiences effectively and I used a few tools (below) to practice my interviews.\n\nYou’ll be asked the same questions again and again in these interviews with HR. With Otter you can transcript the meetings. So I created a document with 'Hard Questions in Job Interviews' as a quick reference during interviews. I have the answers written there for all the typical questions. If you do online meetings, you can keep the doc open on your second screen 😛\n\n  \n **3 Use case (or technical exercise)**\n\nMy metric here was the number of job offers I received. This stage varies a lot depending on your role. I was applying for Product Manager, in case you are also applying for this role let me know and I can give you some examples of exercises I prepared in advance\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Here are the tools that played a significant role in that process: \n\n **1 ChatGPT - Turned into a job interview trainer** \n\n You start by training ChatGPT on your resume. You can use this prompt:\n\n>As ChatGPT, you’ll be participating in an interview simulation for the position of Product Manager at \\_\\_\\_\\_. I’ll provide you with your Resume in an upcoming message. Following that, you’ll receive the interview questions along with guidelines on how to respond. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Then you copy&Paste your CV on ChatGPT. And you give it this new prompt:\n\n>The focus of this interview will be on your soft skills. When answering questions be clear and concise, using everyday language. Create convincing responses that an interviewer would appreciate even if they are fictional. However, ensure that your answers align with the experiences mentioned in your resume. \n\nThen ask ChatGPT the interview questions you may get and it will be generating perfect responses to any question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **2 kickresume.com**  \n\nUse it to improve your resume. You can do several things with it. Start your resume from scratch or modify one, create your cover letter with AI (it uses ChatGPT on the backend), or ask for feedback on your resume. I still needed to do a lot of manual changes in the version it creates but it is a great start. For cover letters, which can be quite a hassle to customize for each job application, it was a real-time-saver. Another option is Rezi, I haven’t tried it yet but it looks promising. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **3 Wave.ai** \n\nIt provided a written conversation with a real human coach, utilizing AI to offer guidance and assistance. The coaching sessions helped me develop habits for finding the right jobs and mentally preparing for interviews. I used it a lot in stage 2. I would go to Wave with the answers I replied on every interview and they would help me improve them with feedback. Ultimately, they also helped me negotiate the offers. I’m so bad at facing conflict and asking for a higher salary, that my first instinct when I was offered the first job was to say OMG OF COURSE. I was able to raise the salary a bit and also the stock options they gave to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **4 Otter.ai** \n\nYou can use it during your online meetings to take notes. During job interviews, it is not only important the content of your answer, but also how your answer is structured. And the only way to improve this is by practicing. With this tool,  I could review the questions asked and my responses, allowing me to refine and better structure my answers. Write down your answers and then use ChatGPT to improve them and structure them in a way that is easier to understand! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **5 Interview Warmup (from Google)** \n\nSimilar use to the first one with ChatGPT but in this case they ask you the questions. It simulates a real interview and gives you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve. Also, by practicing with these tools, I felt more confident and prepared for those higher-stakes real interviews.\n\n \n\nI hope this is helpful to you!\n\nAny other tool I should add?",13uxdwu,5502,1685372695

914,A year ago today I made a mistake that ruined my life,"Throwaway since my friends know my Reddit. A year ago I was making good money working for a small tech startup. CEO was an ass but I usually didn’t have to deal with him and I loved my coworkers. I also had just bought a house and spent a chunk of savings on renovations. \n\nA recruiter hits me up and mentions a big salary increase at their company. I figured sure why not talk to them. I had 2 calls and next was to be with the founder. Turns out the founder knew the CEO of my company. He called my CEO and said I was looking around. I was immediately fired with no severance. \n\nSince then I’ve sent out thousands of applications and had tons of interviews. Most companies had 4+ rounds. 3 months later I get an offer but instead of remote like they initially said, they wanted me to work in their office on the other side of the country for six months before going remote. I turned it down figuring another offer would come soon. It didn’t. \n\n I’ve dealt with horrible hiring managers, a couple examples is one asked me about my parents occupations and then turned me down saying they wanted someone who grew up around success so they knew what it looked like. one company had me write a blog as part of the process and months after being ghosted by them I found my blog on their website. I won’t even get into being ghosted, hiring managers showing up late or not at all. \n\nI thought my journey finally came to an end. I accepted an offer. It was 40% less than what they originally said they would pay. I’d also have to travel by train 2 hours each day but I was desperate so I took it. \n\nOn Friday I was informed my offer was rescinded due to restructuring and they won’t reimburse me on my $300 a month train package I had just bought to travel to work. \n\nMy old company is thriving and my old colleagues are still doing well in spite of the market. \n\nMeanwhile I’m out of savings and unemployment ran out a while ago.

918,I am so fed up with every company's complete lack of proper training. Every single job is just dropping right in the deep end and hoping for the best.,"I work as an engineer in a very highly regulated, very technical industry at a massive company. There are countless forms, processes, procedures, regulations, requirements, etc that need to be navigated in order to get even the smallest little thing done. Absolutely no one fully understands how all of this shit works together because everyone is so siloed into their incredibly narrow scope of work. In order to get any information from people, you need to ask absurdly specific questions that require in-depth understanding of all this shit that I, who started 6 months ago, do not possess. \n\nOkay so you would think I get training on all this once I start? Fuck no. I get chucked into the deep end because my lead likes 'on the job training' and 'learn by doing'. What he really means is I don't want to train you at all so good luck! Every project inevitably results in me beating my head against a brick wall trying to eek out the smallest clues from people about what to do next because A) I don't even know the right questions I should be asking and B) like I said before, no one actually understands all this shit in its entirety and everyone has their own opinions and interpretations. There's 2 dozen people at a minimum involved in any particular project and 95% of them will flat out ignore all emails too. All of the 'experts' and actual decision makers are so noncommittal and vague in their responses to my questions and requests that it ends up creating more confusion, at least on my end. \n\nI've gotten zero training on how to navigate this fucking labyrinth of bureaucracy.

921,The real problem with job hunting in the US is that employers REFUSE to pay livable wages.,"It's ridiculous. I'm currently in contact with a recruiter who said they would send my resumes out to companies and get back to me if any want to interview me. Well, I got some jobs back. \n\nResults:\n\nTexas: An $18-$20/hr office admin job (no thanks)\n\nAlso Texas: A purchasing agent job for $20/hr (also no thanks)\n\nIndianapolis: An inside sales position offering $40k-$45k depending on experience.\n\nAll of these jobs prefer having Japanese/English bilingual skills ON TOP OF the skills required to perform the jobs... for a measly $20/hr. No matter how bad I want to get out of the dumpsterfire that is Idaho right now I'm not going to pack up and leave only to end up in the exact same situation I'm currently in, and likely end up worse off. It makes no sense.\n\nThis is not the first time this has happened with recruiters. All I ask for is a livable wage. Doesn't happen. I'm not moving half-way across the country for $20/hr. It'd be cheaper to get a basic English teaching job in Japan and I'd save more money given the CoL over there too. \n\nI don't know why I try with recruiters anymore. I think I'm done job shopping in the US and am honestly just going to go back to Japan at this point. At least over there I can actually save money on even $30k/year...",13f6wda,4871,1683855800
922,I'm deaf. My boss might fire me because I 'illegally' recorded our phone conversations.,"I use a speech to text app on my phone which is government funded to allow deaf people to be able to communicate, and it creates a transcript of every call I make. To my knowledge there is no setting to turn off the transcript feature, and it's a separate phone number that people call as opposed to the number that they generally text me at. \n\nIn one of those calls my boss asked that I disclose a private medical issue to the office in order to relieve concerns from people I do not even work with. I was very bothered by this, because he implied that it would improve my performance rating and bonus structure if I were to do so. I complained to HR and showed her the transcript of the call, and now he's saying that it was illegal for me to record that conversation without his consent.\n\nI am already getting a lawyer but I'm very anxious. Am I wasting my money here? He knows that I'm functionally deaf and in fact, he approved my accommodations when I requested a transcription software for in person meetings. How could he not have known our conversation was being recorded?",1adyk9a,4846,1706543737
923,'Unlimited' or 'Flexible' PTO policies suck if your teammates never take time off.,"Rant - I started a job about 10 months ago with a 'flexible' PTO policy. Essentially, I have unlimited time off, to use at my discretion, up to 2 weeks at a time. I understand the other arguments against these open-PTO policies but something else has become abundantly clear to me having been with this job for about a year now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is, my immediate teammates (there are 5 of us) NEVER take time off. So what ends up happening is, I am the 'slacker' of the team. I do not hesitate to take a random Friday off if work is slow, and I plan to take whole weeks off for various trips and vacations coming up this summer and fall. All in all, I will probably take 4 weeks of total PTO this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get my work done on time and am generally well-liked with the company and team, but I feel like an ass because in comparison to the rest of my teammates, I take a lot of time off. I want to be there for my team and pick up some of their work when they take their own time off, but they (as mentioned above) rarely or never take time off, so I have yet been able to prove my ability to be a good teammate. I speak with folks from other departments and they regularly take time off, sharing fun stories about the trips they've taken and the places they've seen - yet another thing I do not get to share with my team because they are too caught up working to speak about anything else besides work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/end rant. I am not necessarily looking for any advice here, maybe just some affirmations or similar stories from other people with PTO policies like this. This too could also be used as a point of consideration for anyone weighing the pros/cons of 2 jobs with different PTO policies, I guess.",136kh70,4835,1683120292
924,"I’m fully employed, but doing a job search as I hate my current job. Why is the hiring/interview process so bad these days?","Very fortunately, I got an internship with a large company my senior year of college. My interview for this position was 11 minutes long. Now, I’m sure there were some preconceived notions about me that the employer had, but still an 11 minute interview. \n\nI got hired on full-time for this company after graduation, so I did not need to interview at all. Fast forward some months, a chunk of the marketing team is wiped and a bunch of us are jobless at the beginning of 2023. \n\nAgain, fortunately I get a new job that was recommended to me by a connection. This interview was a quick phone interview, and then an in person interview that was max 20 minutes.\n\nNow, I hate this job. It pays the bills, but everyone here hates one specific person that cannot be fired due to them being a family member of the owner (this is a very small company). I just can’t take it anymore and there’s no benefits so it doesn’t feel worth my distress. Only good thing is that it’s the same salary as my previous job.\n\nI’ve been applying to jobs, getting the typical ghosting and rejection emails at 12am from being filtered out by a computer. I encountered something weird today. I got kicked off the candidate list during a second round interview as a no-show. However, they scheduled a time that was outside of my given availability, and I told them twice before the interview that I could not make that time and they just ignored my emails. They asked me to reapply, which NO I AM NOT. \n\nWhy is hiring so WEIRD right now?",15i3lzt,4823,1691164061

926,UPDATE-My new boss that I’ve never met asked me to come to their home.,"First off I want to thank everyone for their advice. It was extremely helpful to have others chime in to validate that this whole situation was extremely odd and inappropriate. It made made me feel confident that I could put a boundary in place that my safety was non negotiable. \n\nNow on to what happened next-Like I said in my previous post I stated I felt unsafe to the owner, they then replied that they could get me a ride to their home (costing close to $200 which gets rid of the theory they didn’t want to rent a space due to money concerns). \nI declined the ride and then repeated my concern about safety going to their home and asked if we could do the training remotely or if we could meet in a public space where I could possibly bring someone. I thought this would make them second guess their behavior because surely any rational person wouldn’t want to make a potential employee feel unsafe? \n\nNOPE that’s not how this went. They sent me long email back telling me that essentially the only way I could have this job is if I go to the owners house. They stated that they cannot hold meetings anywhere but their house due to “information privacy” concerns (please keep in mind this is not a government job or anything where sensitive confidential information would be exchanged). \nThey then went on to say that I could absolutely NOT bring anyone. So bottom line-I would have to show up to their home, alone. The kicker is they then stated that they’re second guessing me as a candidate because I voiced these concerns and they only want “likeminded” “collaborative” employees…\n\nMoral of the story is listen to your gut and stay safe when searching for jobs. I’m not sure what is going on here but I’m happy that I didn’t go. I’m not sure if I should reach out to the job posting site that I originally applied on to let them know about this. I just don’t want anyone else to end up in an unsafe situation because they need a job.  \nThanks again everyone!!",15eery0,4664,1690806322

953,FIRED! WITHOUT WARNING- Escorted out by Security!,"A great employee at my office was FIRED yesterday.  Everyone was in total shock.  Jerry had been there for years and had a history of hard work, success, technical expertise and got along with everyone.  He worked in Purchasing and was a college educated professional making about 80K a year for a large organization.\n\nA new boss came in and was aloof to Jerry but never told him his performance was substandard.  But yesterday the new boss and HR called Jerry into his office and fired him.  Told Jerry it was not a good fit.  There was no history of warnings or poor performance appraisals.  No misconduct was brought up during the termination.  This was not a reduction in force or layoff There was no severance, no warning, no apology.  Jerry was escorted out by Security.\n\nJerry sent his friends an email to say good by.  He claimed this was a complete shock and there had been no warning at all.  Just a broad claim of lack of fit during the brief termination meeting.\n\nCan this be true?  Is it common that managers will fire someone who had been with the company for over five years without warning or reason?  Or is Jerry lying to us all?\n\n(Yes, **employment at will is legal and people can be fired for no reason.**  But what impact will such actions have on morale or turnover?  Lots of Jerry's coworkers now assume the same thing will happen to them, so they are updating their resumes.)\n\nHave you seen a sudden termination without warning or real reason happen where you work?",1ag7ugw,3880,1706782839
954,I have been employed steadily since I was 14 yrs old. Now 44 and unemployed since March. Is the job market really this bad or does indeed suck?,"I have always had a job and the last two were careers. I was a employee and business owner of 15 years that employed 12-16 employees in the restaurant bar industry. I recently left CDCR after 8 years as I had family issues with elderly parents arise and needed a change. I know have been applying to jobs of indeed here in California with no luck. I have found that if I find a posting but go to the actually company website I can apply and actually get an interview. That being said after the interviews I get ghosted or the dreaded “We have moved on in the hiring process” rejection email. I have applied to a private for profit Nursing school as an attempt to get into a stabile career that I could possibly use to enhance my current retirement savings and work in as my last career. I am nuts, doing something wrong, or under estimating what really going on in the job market? Or is it me?

955,How can I explain that I cannot work full time in a job interview?,"For context I have an invisible chronic illness which heavily restricts my ability to most things. I'm a 25 yo woman so I almost always get the 'but you don't look ill' stare whenever I mention I'm disabled. I have tried working 20-25 hours a week before and it has not been sustainable.\n\n I have applied and been interviewed for quite a few jobs in the last 6(ish) months, each advertised as 12-16 hours per week. In each of these interviews I have been asked what my other commitments are/why I'm applying for part time work and I have been honest and said that I have a chronic illness which restricts my availability. Each time I've gotten 'the stare' from the interviewer and I have rarely even got a reply from them regarding my interview. All of these jobs are basic retail jobs that I am more than qualified for.\n\nHow can I answer these types of questions without jeopardising my chances by mentioning my disability?\n\nEDIT: thank you for all the responses! My biggest fear/issue is that when filling out paperwork at the interview stage, employers give out a timetable for a week (monday morning, afternoon, evening etc) and ask to tick when I'm available. Of course, I could work at any time or day, but not more than the part time hours. I worry that employers will see that I'm available and expect me to be able to work whenever they need. My previous retail jobs have done the same. I think I need to overcome the anxiety I get when I'm asked and learn to be more stern with my answers",15o4qi5,3789,1691748422

957,I've interviewed and hired hundreds of people.,"I stumbled across this channel and read some of the posts and it occurred to me that there are a lot of questions and opinions being floated but I haven't seen any actionable advice. I have seen some bad advice. \n\nFirst: Who am I? I work these days in technology but I've been a carpenter, I've worked in the marine industry as a boat captain and various scut work jobs, Ive been a graphic designer, and I have been a Product Management leader for 25+ years with VP, SVP and CPO titles. I've worked at huge companies, mid-sized companies and I've founded four companies, two of which I was the CEO. \n\nSo at the risk of pontificating, I thought I'd share some thoughts:\n\nFirst: People are looking for coworkers - meaning people who they like, who are at the same level of *competence* as the rest of the team (not experience), who get things done, who are reliable, and who are creative problem solvers. Even at unsophisticated jobs, being a creative problem solver is a huge plus. You have to come across as likable. And ideally you want the interviewer to start rooting for you to be successful. \n\nSo how do you do that? You have to arrive at an interview ready to tell stories that capture the interviewer's attention and illustrate your value. Most interviewers are not good at interviewing, so you need to help them along. \n\nThese days I screen for 4 things when I hire.  I believe these things are universally desirable and necessary in order to be successful at any job: Grit, Integrity, Empathy and Creativity. \n\nI believe that if you can exhibit and illustrate these four traits in an interview, you have a much better chance of being hired.  So what do these things mean, and how do you illustrate them?\n\n1. Grit:  this is the ability to get a task or project done, even if you run into obstacles. You need to illustrate that you have initiative, that you can identify and solve problems that are blocking you (sometimes this means asking for help, especially if you're junior), but mostly it means you keep on trying even if things get hard. \n\nSo have a story queued up that you can use to illustrate your grit. Tell a story about a really hard problem you had to solve. Summarize the background, explain what obstacles you ran into, and how you solved them. For a first job or if you're junior (1-3 years) telling a story that isn't work related is okay.  Or a situation where you recognized a problem beyond your skill level and escalated to get help from your boss or a senior colleague, and then completed the project. Sometimes showing that you're a team player and that you have the humility to ask for help is better than struggling alone. However, if you're more senior, showing that you know how to get things done independently is probably more important.\n\n2. Integrity: Are you trustworthy and reliable? Illustrate that you have integrity by telling about a time you had a moral or ethical quandary and had to make the hard decision to do the right thing. Or if you're brave, a time you did the wrong thing but learned from that failure. To be clear, I'm not talking about a time you made a mistake, I'm talking about the time you failed, the time you did the wrong thing, you knew it, you made the decision, and faced some consequences. Of course it's important that if you go down that path that your focus is on what you learned and why you won't make that mistake again. This can be really important if you have anything in your background that could become visible through a simple social media search or background check. Showing vulnerability in an interview, especially around integrity, can be the thing that gets an interviewer to start rooting for your success. \n\n3. Empathy: This is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, walk around, see things from their perspective, and make decisions based on that insight. I would tell a story about a time when you struggled to work with someone else, perhaps you didn't even like that person, perhaps you disliked that person. But then you suddenly had an insight into why they were acting the way they were, or what was driving them, you developed a sense of empathy for them, and were able to work through the issues. Maybe you forged a great relationship, or maybe you just found a way to get by with a difficult coworker. Either way this will illustrate empathy and the ability to collaborate with people even if they are difficult.\n\n4. Creativity: This one is a bit trickier. When I interview candidates, I ask a question designed to elicit a story about creativity. So be careful about how you interject this in the conversation. Tell a story about a time you figured out a solution to something difficult in a creative way, maybe talking about a business you started, even something as simple as a lawnmowing business as a kid or a project you did at church or a summer project.  I ask the person to tell me an idea they've had for a company or a product or a nonprofit or service and what is exciting about it to them. Then I ask them to think through several aspects of the idea and expand on it until they finally either prove that they can think things through and to end, or they run into a wall at some point. Either way, it's very illuminating as an interviewer.\n\nI hope this is helpful. Just remember, hiring managers are looking for team members. They're figuring out if they like you as well as if you're qualified. So it's really important that you let them look at you, the real you, so they can assess you for who you actually are. I've Filled people out of an interview process because they were too guarded and weren't letting me get to know them.\n\nOne last thing. As much as you are being interviewed, you should be interviewing them. Show up with good questions, do research about the company before you show up, and have a good reason for why you want to work there. If you discover that you don't like the people interviewing you , find out if they are someone you will have to work with every day or if they are not someone you will work with every day. It may not be worth it to take the job if you don't like the people.",12n00ua,3722,1681560046
958,People don't understand just how torturing and soul crushing long-term unemployment can be.,"6 months and counting here.\n\nI've done everything you're supposed to do. I have a (supposedly) competitive MSc from a (supposedly) top uni. I have technical skills. I have internships with big names on my CV and good references. I speak languages. I know people. I apply left and right. I use keywords. I have a CV that's been professionally reviewed. I engage with people on LinkedIn. Job searching is a full time job by this point. And still I have nothing to show for it.\n\nIt's completely soul shattering. I have no money and no savings left. My friends and acquintances have a life, do things, get married, make plans, give birth to kids, start mortgages, book trips. I can't do anything, because I don't have money and I am depressed because I feel like I have no future. And it's a self growing vicious feedback loop: I get constant rejections, so I get depressed, so I don't even bother applying because I will get rejected anyways, so I don't progress, so I get even more depressed.\n\nI spend every waking minute waiting for that email that could turn things around. Days go by painfully slowly. Some hiring manager that will care about me and give me a chance. But it never happens. And when Friday afternoon comes I get that oppressing sense of dread that comes from knowing yet another week has passed and now it's the weekend and no one will reply anyways, and then Monday will come and another week will pass and so on and so forth. It's a torture. It's exhausting.\n\nI am at the end of my rope. Not only I cannot find a skilled job, but I won't get considered for an unskilled one because I'm too old and qualified - not that a random unskilled job would help matters anyway since I'd barely have money to feed myself (my mom has to pay for my food right now) and I still wouldn't be building anything resembling a future and a career for myself, so I'd still be in the same place as I am now.\n\nI have studied for years and went repeatedly out of my comfort zone and now this.\n\nI've had an actual disease in the past. I still felt better than I feel now. At least I had something to be positive about. I had hope it would end. I knew that if I followed medical advice I'd come out the other side. Now it's out of my control. I can't control hiring managers deciding on a whim against advancing me to the next stage. I can't control the fact that even if I do a great interview there might still be something that I do worse than someone else. I cannot control the fact that each time there might be even just one single applicant who's slightly better than me. I can't control anything. I can't *do* anything.",155pydt,3716,1689950507

She’s narcissistic and loves to throw things in your face. I let her know I may be calling off work more often due to my surgery and the unpredictability of when I’m not feeling well. Last week I got so sick to the point I was throwing up and she had the nerve to tell me not to call off because she has plans. After I quit she kept saying I ruined her plans and not once during my recovery did she even check on me to see if I was ok. I stayed longer than I should have.

970,"Company laid me off suddenly, now wants me back for less pay","I was very suddenly laid from my job 2 days ago. Effective immediately. I worked as a data analyst/applications manager/the-only-person-knowledgeable-about-anything-computer-related for a small healthcare group. The company has relied on COVID funding since it's inception, so naturally the funding has dried up and they're downsizing. They (the CEO) took a look at my salary and decided to cut my position, immediately. I had no time to stop what I knew would inevitably happen. Backend processes and automations started crashing, and they will soon be out of compliance with local, state, and federal regulations (they don't realize this yet, and they won't until they get the notice that they're in breach of contract- which could take a few weeks). The contract they're operating under ends in a few months, so I was expecting to be laid off in a few months anyways, but not like this.\n\nI've been getting panicked texts and emails ever since saying they want to bring be back on part-time, at a substantially lower rate than I was making. No one, not even my boss, knows how to maintain a spreadsheet, let alone the other applications I implemented to keep their business running smoothly.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I don't want to take the part-time, less pay offer. It's insulting. From my personal, guilt-ridden perspective, the company provides healthcare to a vulnerable population, and my co-workers, through no fault of their own, will soon lose the ability to care for these patients.\n\nAny advice how to navigate this?\n\nTo note: I don't need the job right now, and was actually relieved to be laid off after working in a COVID-response capacity the past 3 and a half years. Financially, I'll be ok if I don't work for a couple months, so while the paycheck would be nice, I don't *need* it. \\*acknowledging my privilege to be in such a position\\*\n\nTLDR: I was laid off 2  days ago with no notice. Things started falling apart. No one knows how to fix it, so they want me back - for less pay.  \n....\n\nUpdate:  Thank you everyone for your recommendations! I've never been laid off or fired before, I've always left on my own. So while I won't be accepting the offer, I didn't know how to respond. I told them I would take the weekend to consider it (make em sweat a bit). I also discovered that they will not be paying out my unused vacation time. I'm torn between straight up rejecting their offer, or countering with the suggestions of charging $200/hr as a contractor to fix things over the next month or so. However, I get the inkling that they're setting up to just let it all burn down. I'm pretty sure the CEO is just pocketing as much profit as possible before the contracts end. \n\nThis company poached me from the agency that monitors if they're in compliance. I can easily get a job with them again, and probably with their competitor. I'll be applying for unemployment to tie me over. I don't need a job immediately, so I'm not stressed about that aspect.  \n\nUpdate 2: \nI declined their offer,  stating it was not a suitable offer for my skillset and expertise. I did not counter offer. A corporate lawyer friend advised that it could come across as threatening. I have no regrets. I'm slowly applying for new jobs and have had 1 interview already. I'm mostly enjoying the time off, though, and hope to have another month or so to enjoy the peace.",15uz73k,3445,1692399553

972,I'm an entry level employee and was very publically reprimanded by the CFO. How would you handle this?,"Context:\n\nI was a psych major and a preschool teacher prior to getting this gig for a small (300 employees) aerospace/defense contractor. It's an administrative role doing the boring, tedious stuff that the subcontract managers don't have time for. Knew it wouldn't be fun, but I figured it would be a solid springboard job to open up more avenues (plus full remote).\n\nSo, I've been here for almost 6 months. Things have gone fine, I got a raise very early on and my immediate colleagues have been pleased given that I came in with no knowledge or experience in *any* of this. Don't particularly like the role or the contract/subcontracts field but I planned to stick around for at least a year.... Until now. \n\nThe Incident:\n\nThe other day, I got an email from the CFO. Immediately, I notice that a TON of people are CCd. Every member of the contracts, subcontracts and accounting department, as well as several other high ranking figures. \n\nI start reading and... Oh god... It's really aggressive. And it's talking about things I'm responsible for. Specifically, it was about delays in the processing of certain invoices and how it's severely hurting cash flow. He goes on and on with words like 'unacceptable' and 'ridiculous' and how serious discussions need to be had about responsible parties. I get to the bottom...\n\nThere I see an email screenshot with my name circled in red to make it clear that this email was a targeted call-out. I was stunned and I still am. The freaking *CFO* just bypassed at least two links in the chain of command to personally put me, one of the lowest level employees in the company, on blast in front of every person I ever have or ever will interact with. I've never even met/spoken to the guy. There's gotta be some kind of achievement for that.\n\nObviously, this was humiliating and a huge blow to my ego. There was a lot of crying, self-pity and 'Oh God, I'm a failure, I'm an idiot' and all that. I'm not gonna act like I'm some top-shelf, above-and-beyond employee, but the delays I was being targeted for were mostly out of my control (I can go into detail about this if anyone cares to know). Basically, tiny bit my fault, but mostly not. \n\nMy manager was absolutely FURIOUS at the CFO.  He immediately jumped to my defense and helped drag my catatonic corpse through the process of proving that my performance was, indeed, satisfactory. \n\nMy manager then proceeded with an absolute baller move; He wrote an email laying out info and evidence in my favor and commending me, making sure to copy EVERY person the CFO had copied. Very grateful for that.\n\nDespite my manager's defense, I feel I have an extremely unwanted spotlight on me now along with irreparable damage to my virtually non-existent reputation. The bridge is sufficiently burned and I don't feel comfortable working somewhere I'm seen as an idiot or a liability. To make matters worse, this experience which should hypothetically light a fire under my ass has left me feeling completely apathetic. I just want to bow out and leave with the lessons and surface-level business experience I came for. Admit to myself that I'm not cut out for it. \n\nIt's certainly not the end of the world but it really sucks.

983,"“No one wants to work anymore”, because no one wants to train anymore.","It’s funny, I had a shower thought this morning. Some Indeed posts for very basic jobs require prior experience with specific software. I’m not talking about experience with Excel or Salesforce. I’m talking experience with software in a niche industry. For example, I apply to a lot of general clerical positions in healthcare. They want someone with YEARS of prior use in a particular optical-specific program used only in optometry offices, etc. Same goes for other smaller practices/offices. \n\nI know usually those are not difficult to learn. The most basic 2 week training is all that’s required to learn all these programs. I know because I’ve managed to learn many of them quickly for different jobs. You don’t need to be a genius to catch on, especially if applying for an entry level position. \n\nSeeing these ridiculous requirements makes me laugh and makes me think of employers who claim “no one wants to work anymore”. I can say the same thing for employers - none want to train anymore. Not even a measly 2 weeks. \n\nSo sick of posting after posting paying $18 an hour with several years experience required. Get out of here with that. No one is going to invest in applying to your job posting filling out an outdated application form, if you don’t invest in new hires.",13l7jyr,3150,1684436283
984,By now I am convinced that companies/bosses dont have a clue what their employees are actually doing,Entered this company a year ago as an office allrounder. From moment one I was overwhelmed with work. Most months I did 20-30 hours of overtime because there was so much work (all-in contract so no overtime payment). Several times I told my superior that I needed a colleague to help me.\n\nThis was frequently ignored and more work dumped on me. It was always claimed that I didnt have so much to do and that getting x done requires just one email - getting y done requires just half an hour. Two weeks ago I was fired because 'I didnt do enough work and it wasnt thorough enough'....\n\nNow guess who has been trying to reach me for the past few days? My old a-hole boss. Turns out I was the only one doing like 5 important tasks that no one else had a clue about. They now want my contacts and work progress reports etc.\n\nOf course I wont respond - but its comical how they just fired me - and now they realized that I have been doing important stuff. That I was the only on doing this important stuff.\n\nBosses/companies have absolutely no idea what their employees are doing huh?,16gucxp,3123,1694532523

I waited an hour for him to get settled and then went in to talk to him and said 'I am mortified, I sent the factory pricing to client AB by mistake. Are we able to offer her a discount as an apology?'\n\nMy boss called the client and told her I sent them the wrong pricing and we need to update the order. The client said they already calculated their pricing based on what I gave them and in turn sent a purchase order with that info to ***their*** client. Our client is refusing to go back on this, won't accept a discount, and they are not happy.\n\nMy boss is furious with me and said he has never seen this kind of mistake in all his years in the industry. He is 'speechless'. We gave the client an order for free and lost money. The loss is actually around $2,400. He also said now he has to go back and check all the pricing I ever sent to clients because those could be wrong, too.\n\nToday (Friday), my boss was originally going to be out of office but he ended up coming in to give me a performance improvement plan and he stayed the whole day, until 6:30 p.m. It was another horrible day. I know he is going to fire me and the PIP is only to protect himself so I cannot claim unemployment benefits. He fired someone last month for less because they were asking him too many questions. They were only there 3 weeks. My boss says he always wants us to ask him questions but then if he doesn't like the questions you are asking you are doomed. So if he will fire someone for asking a lot of questions no doubt he will fire someone who lost money for his company.My boss was originally going to be out of office on Friday but he ended up coming in to give me the PIP and he stayed the whole day, until 6:30 p.m. It was another horrible day.\n\nSo yeah, I ripped the band aid off, got it over with and came clean but as expected it has been an unpleasant working environment and it is never going to get better. My boss isn't wrong with the things he is saying to me though. I feel awful I made that mistake. I suck and am a horrible employee. I am dreading Monday.\n\nEDIT: Wow, was not expecting so many responses. Thank you so much everyone for your input, advice and kind words. I keep coming back here to read for support because I am trying not to feel so awful.\n\nMy boss is mad about the $$ loss but even more mad that I sent our internal costs to the customer. He thinks I am a moron. He doesn't have to say that exact word but the way he has been talking and treating me says it all. He again said this is a mistake he has never seen someone make before. The past two days have been awful and as soon as I come home I start crying. I want to quit.

990,I accidentally out dressed management,"\n\nI work in a small laid back office and no one tends to dress up. Our company has several local clients so we hosted a holiday party and invited the clients as a thank you. I helped plan the party with 2 others.\n\nMy manager said that she was going to take some photos of us at the event for our company’s Facebook page so to look nice. She didn’t define “look nice” but I took this as dress up so that’s what I did. I wore a dress, nice shoes, perfume, makeup, jewelry and had my hair curled. \n\nMany of my coworkers wore our company T-shirt and jeans. My boss wore jeans with a nice sweater but it was still jeans so not too dressed up.\n\nA lot of the clients talked to me like I was the boss. The division manager showed up (dressed on about the same level as me) and she gave me like this hateful looking stare which made me uncomfortable. Others said they liked my outfit but I wondered if they were just being nice. After looking at the Facebook photos and showing my family, they all said it was a nice outfit.\n\nBut in the last two weeks, my direct boss has been kind of dismissive to me. I also feel like I was left out of a meeting I should have been on recently and some recurring ones that she scheduled. I can sense a change that I think is related to over dressing which was not my intention to outshine anyone. I just thought we were supposed to dress up. Any advice or similar experience? I’m starting to think it’s better to underdress than to overdress at office parties.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the comments. I tried to read them all and hope I didn’t miss any.

992,Serious: I walked into my CEOs office and thanked him,"I have been working with my company for about 2 years now. It’s a small to medium sized company with less than 100 employees generating about $100M+ /year rev. I don’t hold the best paying roles and I had been hopeful for a raise of some sort. Especially my reviews with my bosses were always positive. \n\n\nRight before last Christmas (2018) my baby boy was diagnosed with a rare case of infant leukemia (blood cancer). Doctors in the ICU gave us less than 20% survival rate. Both my wife and I were devastated and felt like we got sucked into a black hole of sadness. My boss talks with his boss and allows me to be off for 2 weeks. Last thing I had in my mind was work and they understood that. Soon we received the road map for the infant cancer treatment protocol and we were expected to be inpatient for basically the first 6 months of the 24 months treatment. \n\nRight before the end of 2 weeks, I receive an email from my HR with my CEO cc’d in it stating that my company is granting me UNLIMITED PTO. I was not expected to do any work but to invest all my time with my baby. And that’s what I did. I stayed in the hospital for 6 long months at the cancer unit. \n\nAfter finishing the front line of treatment ( first 6 months), my son went in remission (MRD negative) and we came home . My wife officially quit her job to stay with him at home and I decided to come back to work as our life is getting some sort of flow. \n\nAfter coming back to work, I heard from others how my CEO took the initiative to the board and other co-founders and pushed to offer the support I received. \n\nSo recently I saw him at his office and his door was open. So I knocked on the side and walked into his office. I was very nervous but I shook his hand and thanked him for all he had done for me and my family and how helpful it was for us to have at least one income. He quietly listens to me and says “we didn’t want you worry about work while you’re taking care of your family and that was the right thing to do” and he stood up and gave me a big bear hug. \n\n\nMy heart is filled with gratitude and respect for him and the entire company. Small companies have challenges and they make mistakes as they grow. But these types of act of kindness makes me want to work for this company as long as I can.\n\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for reading this post. A lot of people are asking for the name of the company to give kudos. I didn’t mention any name because I wanted their kindness to maintain its innocence. Maybe I’ll ask.",c255l2,2981,1560879062

I told him that it's insulting at this point, and that if he had offered me the position a few months ago I wouldn't have started job searching and would've been elated.

Which was up front, as it should be done.\n\nAt the end of the day, he tries to act apologetic, insisting that he didn't mean to 'be a dick', suddenly concerned that I'm acting like I would rather be anywhere else. And frankly, that's the truth. I never want to put that shirt on again, I don't want to set foot near the meat department. The dude knew I was coming in to train, shoveled a workload on my shoulders that I couldn't handle, and then got pissed at me for his mistakes. On top of that, he left early, leaving me to work out how to restock the freezers on my own, and with no guidance, after yelling at me for most of the day for being too slow.\n\nTo clarify a little, he never used abusive language. But the way he spoke to me was very passive-aggressive, and it just left me feeling put off. 'Come on, man, do I really have to show you again?', and so on. It got worse towards the end of the day, during cleanup, when he repeatedly 'accidentally' sprayed me down with the cleaning water after ridiculing me for not standing closer.\n\nI'm supposed to go in later this week to work regular store stocking, and then go back to the meat department the day after. But I've been suffering a constant migraine since I started crying on Sunday, and every time I think about having to go back in, it gets worse. Is it okay to just quit, even though I said I'd be back in on Thursday? Is this a normal experience? I feel like I'm just being too sensitive, even though I've never had any issues like this with any other job I've had in the past.\n\nEdit: I'm no longer employed as of 1:20 PM EST today. I feel the headache lifting already... Thanks to the people who gave me that push, even if it was a simple one-word 'quit'.",14kieen,2816,1687883509

1009,Does anyone else do mostly nothing all day at their job?,"This is my first job out of college. Before this, I was an intern and I largely did nothing all day and I kinda figured it was because I was just an intern.\n\nNow, they pay me a nicer salary, I have my own office and a $2000 laptop, and they give me all sorts of benefits and most days I’m still not doing much. They gave me a multiple month long project when I was first hired on that I completed faster than my bosses expected and they told me they were really happy with my work. Since then it’s been mostly crickets. \n\nMy only task for today is to order stuff online that the office needs. That’s it. Im a mechanical design engineer. They are paying me for my brain and I’m sitting here watching South Park and scrolling through my phone all day. I would pull a George Castanza and sleep under my desk if my boss didn’t have to walk past my office to the coffee machine 5 times a day.\n\nIs this normal??? Do other people do this? Whenever my boss gets overwhelmed with work, he will finally drop a bunch of work on my desk and I’ll complete it in a timely manner and then it’s back to crickets for a couple weeks. He’ll always complain about all the work he has to do and it’s like damn maybe they should’ve hired someone to help you, eh? \n\nI’ve literally begged to be apart of projects and sometimes he’ll cave, but how can I establish a more active role at my job?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAbout a week after I posted this, my boss and my boss’s boss called me into a impromptu meeting. I was worried I was getting fired/laid off like some of the commenters here suggested might be coming, but they actually gave me a raise.\n\nI have no idea what I’m doing right.

1010,Some company asked me for the second time if I can lower my expected salary. Red flag?,"I got a call last week, had the usual chat and then asked about the salary, which I tried to get to know what they're offering but HR lady just insisted on know my expectations. When I told her, she said something along the lines of 'if I'm open to negotiate for less' to which I replied that this is my minimum and after few more questions the conversation ended.\n\nI got a call from the same lady and her first question was again whats my expectations and again I told her that this is the minimum I can go.\n\nHmm.. what is this exactly? Why are companies being cheap and btw I'm not even asking for much. And even if I'm, they can just decline and move to the next person, insist, she wants me to stick to my current salary, like lady whats the point then??\n\nI think this is a red flag. This doesnt encourage me to even go on the interview.  IF she calls again that is.\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for the support and advice, this is all so new to me and your inputs fellow strangers were really helptful. \nSomeone from this company spoke with my previous manager.

1015,I got a job I'm grossly underqualified for,"I'm 23 years old, graduate college next week, and applied for a creative director role for shits n giggles and this is a role which I anticipated getting 10 years into my career. I somehow ended up getting the job right off the hop and I'm getting pretty anxious about starting. It pays over 100k a year with full benefits, a pension plan, and puts me in a senior management role where I'll be in charge of large-scale creative projects.\n\nWhat the fuck do I do? I obviously couldn't say no but my resume is very much entry-level. I founded a failed start-up and had some short-lived assistant project manager co-op experience but I've never had a role even remotely close to something like this and I'm getting super stressed out about it. My guess is they liked my creative portfolio and saw through the cracks in my experience.\n\nHas anyone had an experience like this? Looking for any/all advice\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: HOLY CRAP!! I never would have expected this kind of response, now I feel downright famous. Thank you everyone for the kind words of support and your tips/ tricks! Here's what I'm taking away from this:\n\n1. Collaborate, don't delegate\n2. Find a mentor (already making some calls!)\n3. Fake it till you make it (but ask LOT'S of questions)\n4. Don't be afraid to lean on my co-workers and ask for their help\n5. Worst-case scenario I get canned and walk away with one hell of a learning experience\n6. Try to have some fun along the way and get to know my co-workers\n7. I've made note of all the books mentioned in the thread so I've got some serious reading to do\n8. Google and youtube are your friends! Do lots of studying behind the scenes\n9. Put in the hours! Stay late, work your ass off, and make it known they chose the right person\n10. Nobody really knows what they're doing and you can figure a lot out on the journey\n11. Save my money, stay humble, and don't act like a dink\n\nFor anyone wondering about the legitimacy due to my wording of a pension plan, I thought that was the same thing as a 401k/RRSP, so that's my bad. Yes, this is a real post, yes they are also on glassdoor and have reviews, no I didn't lie on my resume or inflate my abilities.\n\nI'll make sure to keep this thread updated as things unfold. There is a performance review at the 3-month mark so hopefully, I'll have some great news to share at that point.\n\nEdit 2: I'm a week and a half into this shit and the imposter syndrome is absolutely real lol. People look at me funny when I get introduced and can already feel the pressure building up from my peers. The good news is this might just be in my head and HR is doing a really great job of onboarding me, the first 12 weeks will be spent training me and I'm not going to lie it looks like it's going to be pretty intense. All gas no breaks baby we're in the belly of the beast now.\n\nEdit 3 (Final Update):\n\nAlrighty everyone, today was my 3 month review and we passed!!! It’s been a pretty surreal experience and its hard to put into words but I’ll try my best. The imposter syndrome is gone now and I feel super comfortable being myself in the office and with my co workers. For the first probably 3-5 weeks I was constantly walking on egg shells just trying to watch what I say and how I say it, so I’m glad I can finally relax (obviously still watching what I say and how I say it but you know what I mean). I’ve been given some awesome responsibilities so far but my superiors have made it very clear that this is a slow burning candle, baby steps! \n\nThey said it will probably take a good 6-8 months before I can really take the reins of the role which I’d have to agree. Lots to learn which is super fun but sometimes overwhelming, especially with the organizational tree, I literally printed the org chart so I know who the hell emails me all the time. It’s such a weird feeling getting given bigger projects and being the person that gets to lead them because I’m just sitting there like “grown ups are supposed to do this”, it’s hard for me the describe this feeling but it’s like being a shoe collector and then getting a job designing shoes, you just never expect that YOU would be the person doing something like that and have always assumed people much more capable than you have done those jobs. Weird analogy but I’m hoping someone gets it.\n\nI’ve been learning so much it’s insane but also been given so much flexibility to shake the tree and ruffle some feathers of the way corporate processes are done, especially when it comes to documentation of projects (pretty shocked everything seems to be done verbally or writing on a napkin essentially). This company does massive multi million dollar projects and hardly even bothers making a formal responsibility matrix which leads me into my next point. Office politics.\n\nJesus Christ I’m not going to lie it just sucks. Because these projects are so massive and involve so many departments, but also lack a formal agreed upon responsibility matrix, departments are unwilling to put egos aside and do what’s best for the project and put what’s best for their egos or departments first. Nobody knows what the fuck they’re supposed to be doing. So many departments want to control more budgets which means more control over the projects, which is absolutely mind fucking blowing because I see through all that shit, and quite frankly don’t understand why people take this so seriously as if it’s life or death, which is why I think my bosses were eager to hire someone younger who is going to shake things up and be a scape goat (fine by me if I get to see these idiots bitch about their egos taking a hit). \n\nI’ve been given the green light today to formalize the project life cycle which includes getting all these bodies into a room and agreeing on who does what from now on, right then and there, no more bullshit. Also, I’m not going to get into it too much but 11 of the 100 people in my department are unionized and there is a clear divide behind closed doors between management and them, which puts me in a funny spot because I personally am very much pro-union, although I’d never mention that to my bosses. I just sit there and stay quiet while the chirps are flying.\n\nOverall I’m just so grateful that I’ve been given the chance like this and extremely happy with where I’m at, the work is super satisfying, I really like my co workers, I get an office that I can now pimp out, and it all makes me really makes me hopeful for the future and I genuinely can’t wait for Monday mornings.\n\nI’ll leave this as the last update but thank you everyone for the kind words of encouragement and tips/ tricks, they’ve come in handy many times!\n\nPS.\n\nI’m learning an insane amount of corporate metaphors and analogies lol but here is the hall of fame:\n\n“It’s like giving a puppy a bath” (supposedly means something is tough or slippery I guess)\n\n“Carrot and stick” (you can either give a donkey a carrot and slap it in the ass with a stick)\n\n#TGIF",wl1nde,2763,1660148440

1017,"Job was advertised as hybrid 3 days a week in office, but after signing the offer letter, I was told it's actually full time in office for the first 60 days. Am I right to be suspicious?","Essentially the title. I was laid off from a fully remote job about a month ago, and as we all might know, the job market is completely different from last year. So I received an offer for a senior position that was discussed during the hiring process and subsequent salary negotiation as being 3 days in office, which is not ideal but it's all I have going right now. \n\nI signed the offer and was reviewing the employee handbook/policies when I found an addendum stating that hybrid work was only possible after 60 days FT in office. I expressed concern to the hiring manager as this had not been disclosed until now, and he responded that it was to ensure that I was able to get oriented and up to speed with the pace of the agency. However, I have three years of agency experience (and a total of 8 years in my field), and I've been working fully remote for even longer, which is to say that I have been onboarded remotely quite a few times at this point. It isn't difficult IMO.\n\nI'm meant to start next Tuesday and I haven't responded to the email yet, since I'm not really sure what to say anymore. I'm thinking of suggesting three days on site with a concrete plan for days working offsite, and regrouping as needed when back onsite the following week, also leaning heavily on the fact that I've worked remotely with demonstrated success for a good length of time now.\n\nI kind of want to back out - I have a pretty decent amount of contract work to keep me afloat and I'm pretty far along in the interview process for other positions (which may mean nothing after this week), so I'm thinking about continuing the search, which I honestly planned to do anyway after starting this position since it doesn't really align with what I'm looking for.\n\nAm I wrong for thinking this is disingenuous?

1020,I was muscled out for wanting a $1 raise. I accepted a Job Offer and will be earning DOUBLE my previous salary!,"- I was earning $16.50 an hour as a **Machine Operator**. Basically, the lowest level of a machinest. Every 6 months was a review where, if the production staff performed well, we'd individually be given a merit raise. I did not receive my merit raise of 24¢. The *Production Supervisor* had it out for me from day one. But, I kept my head down, and I persevered. \n\n- Later, in the year 2021, there was a restructuring, and I was transferred to a different team in the same department. I was immediately recognized by my new *Team Lead* and *Production Supervisor*. By the next review date, I was promoted to a **Technical Operator**. Basically, it's a proven machinest. Someone who csn donthe work and do it well, even troubleshooting machinery. For this, I received a pay bump. I was now earning $18.78. \n\n- In early 2022, the employer gave a $2 raise across the board for COLA. I was now earning $20.78 an hour. Not a month later, I applied for an internal job posting. To my surprise, I was promoted to be a covetted **Admin Support**. I was informed that I'd earn $24.78, but last-minute, it was lowered to $22.28. I accepted anyway for the opportunity. \n\n- In the span of 1.5 years, I had increased my pay by $5.78. I was on cloud 9. I diligently did my work, fulfilling all expectations of my new role for a whole year. Then, before my one year review, I found out that compared to other *Admin Support* members, I was earning as much as $5 LESS than them. Admin Support members were being hired externally for $25 an hour. \n\n- In early March, during my year review, I broke down all of my KPI projects and how they've benefitted both the department and the company. All I wanted was a $1 raise. I wanted at minimum to earn $23.28. Instead, I was given 67¢ [[proof]](https://i.imgur.com/XcPBhRZ.jpg). I was told that if I wasn't happy, I could look elsewhere for employment. \n\n- So, I began *quiet quitting*. I did my role and fulfilled my responsibilities? But I stopped going above and beyond. This was immediately noticeable by my supervisor because the small team heavily relied on my *busy bee* work ethic. As the work was being diverted back to her (the supervisor) and my colleague (her best friend), this upset them. \n\n- Unbeknownst to me, she began the process of fabricating *'behavior incidences'* to have me terminated. However, because I was a *high performer* and I was known for getting work done, they couldn't terminate me. So, they demoted me based on these faulty behavior incidences. \n\n- To add insult to injury, not only was I sent back to production, they shipped me to a different department. On an offshift. AND, I had to take a 25¢ paycut. After two weeks in the demoted position, after traversing the **Constructive Termination**, I tossed in the towel and quit. I had nothing lined up. They had won. This was mid-May. \n\n- From mid-May to mid-June, I was applying and interviewing. I had lost hope. I submitted well lver 100 applications. Only a handful gave me the courtesy of a phone screening. Ultimately, I accepted another Machine Operator role somewhere else. It would only pay $18.00 to start. \n\n- Then, I received this offer [[proof]](https://i.imgur.com/SPwBlCF.jpg). I went from wanting a $1 raise and being muscled out for having the gall to ask to now earning nearly **DOUBLE** my salary 🤣 I never thought I'd be here. The validation. The joy. I wouldn't have had this opportunity if my previous employer just gave me a $1 raise. \n\nHang in there. We're all in the struggle. Your time to shine is coming up.

While my job is commission based it is not difficult for me to hit the $100k mark. I work 10 hours a day 5 days a week and every 3rd Saturday.

1040,Companies and corporations do not care about you. Please put your health and wellness before them.,"I never understood why people would skip their breaks or lunch in order to work more. I understand that you want that promotion, but a promotion is not worth your health and wellness. Take your breaks, take your lunch, and do your job well. When you are not at work... you are not at work. You do not have to answer your phone or talk to anyone (unless that was specifically discussed before you got the job).\n\n\n\nCompanies and corporations do not care about you. They care about what you do, and how much you can do. They will abuse you if you let them. They will replace you in a heartbeat. You are worth more than them, and so there is nothing wrong with quitting or putting in your 2 weeks to find a better paying (and treating) job. If that job ends up doing the same thing, rinse and repeat. Fuck them if they try to make you do more than you AGREED to.\n\n\n\nYou are not a hard worker if you start work before you are scheduled to and work after your scheduled time to leave has passed. You are not a hard worker if you work on your lunch. You are not a hard worker if you work on your break. You are not a hard worker if you come to work on your days off because they asked you to. You are not a hard worker if you do work from home outside your scheduled time because they asked you to. All you are, is a fucking idiot.\n\n\n\nBut hey, lets be honest, 90% of people (who actually read this) will wholeheartedly agree with me, then start doing the same stuff that they are doing (examples that I mentioned above).\n\n\n\nThe ones who disagree? Well, the only reasons they disagree, is because they are trying to make themselves feel better by justifying why they are doing these things for a company or corporation that simply does not care about them.\n\n\n\nOr worse, they actually think that they do care about them.\n\n\n\nYour health and wellness is important, always put it before your job. You will live longer and be happier.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Okay, so this post blew up. These are just my thoughts and opinions, and I felt that r/jobs would be the perfect place to post them in.\n\n\nI hope that this post is able to help people.

Job descriptions identical.  I had to do very little revision to my resume because they were THAT close.\n\nThis position is considered entry level at this place.   Not where I am but whatever.  They asked for minimum 3-5 years experience.  I have 10.  They asked for a BS in education.  I have that.  They wanted a masters in Curriculum and Instruction, Instructional Design, or Educational Leadership.  I have the first one.  Salary range commiserated with what I currently make.\n\nThe email states I was rejected for not having enough work experience and not having the correct educational level.\n\nThis tells me a few things:\n\n1.  They didn’t actually read my resume or application which, okay, fine, they probably had a ton, but maybe don’t have a generic email that faults lack of experience when that’s clearly not it.\n\n2.  This was probably posted for legal reasons and they hired someone internally. \n\n3.  I have a masters in the the listed education qualifications.  Again, this is in my LinkedIn and my resume.  My current job also requires this degree level and program to do the job through them.  So to say I don’t have the correct educational level again tells me they didn’t look at it and the email is generic.\n\nIt really floors me that employers are complaining about applicants but have the gull to be so disorganized that they can’t even write a generic rejection email properly.  And the email was sent by the hiring manager.  It wasn’t even like an automatically generated one.",134uvdh,2491,1682962465

1060,"IT HAPPENED. AFTER HUNDREDS OF APPS, DOZENS OF INTERVIEWS, AND MORE REJECTIONS THAN I CAN WRAP MY HEAD AROUND, I GOT AN REMOTE OFFER IN TECH WITH A $40K PAY INCREASE","I’ve had the most emotional rollercoaster of a job search journey…. From being passed up for a well deserved promotion to them trying to bring us back in office, I knew I was done at my company. I’m grateful for the platform to accomplish what I have but I knew it was time to close this chapter and move on to an opportunity that matched my worth. I was pivoting from finance to tech and knew the transition was not going to be easy. \n\nI spent so many HOURS on this forum and online reading, researching, refining my resume like 8 times, practicing interview skills, getting rejected and flat out ghosted so many times… I’ve questioned my value so many times and have felt absolutely DEFEATED. But I always picked myself back up after a few days, held fast to knowing my potential and worth, and kept trying. \n\nFinally, after multiple round interviews and an anxiety inducing wait…. I was given an offer that is fully remote at a global SaaS company, and $40K above my current salary! \n\nWhen I didn’t get the promotion I worked over a year for, it crushed me. I cried for two days straight. It was one of the toughest experiences I’ve gone through. But I’m a fighter and I can say that every time I’ve faced adversity, I pushed back and came out stronger. So after I was done crying I said fuck that. If you don’t value me enough to even give me a roadmap or reason for why I’m not “ready,” then I’m done with you and I’ll find someone who will see me for what I’m worth. As they say, rejection is 100% redirection. If I did get my promotion, I may have ended up staying there for another year or two under the guise of different title with a small 7k increase, commuting everyday into a city I no longer want to live in. Turns out that devastation is what peeled back the onion layers so that I could see what is possible. \n\nI’m elated and so thankful to all of the advice, from the support, encouragement to not give up and knowing your worth, to interview techniques, salary negotiating, and pivoting into tech. I owe it all to the online community and I’m here to say DONT GIVE UP. WORK HARD, RESEARCH, REFINE YOURSELF, AND PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!!!!

1066,Very uncomfortable at a new job after involving hookers in a business trip.,"So I got hired in a company after moving to a new city.\n\nFirst few weeks were ok so far. Coworkers, despite their blunt way of communicating sometimes, are professional, 'to the point' and do their job.\n\nAs this company is in semiconductors industry, frequent business trips to Asia are to be expected and are part of my job. \n\nSo a few days ago I came back from my first trip in Asia with some of my new coworkers, and I admit to be baffled by what happened here.\n\nThe first days of the trip was pretty usual: we dealt with the client, endless meetings and negotiations. Things then went well and objectives were pretty much met. So we decided to relax, go visit the city and eat at a restaurant. That's where things started to get weird: while we were drinking beer, my coworkers decided to hire local hookers for the night and blow some celebration.  \n\nI was quite surprised, cause they all are married with kids. But hey, its their private life, they do they and none of my business. I still felt it was gross, lame and cringey. But, again, as long as no one is hurt, they are free men.\n\nHowever, they started to peer pressure me to go with them and participate in this prostitute party thing. Scrolling pictures of girls on hooker websites, showing them to me 'Which one would be for you? This one! You think she'll be able to fit you in?' while laughing.\n\nI mean, I am in a relationship too and they know it. I refused and frankly started to get pissed because they insisted, mocked me etc. Then, one of them a bit drunk angrily said that basically my attitude won't help me integrate the company and become part of the 'pack' (ie the team).\n\nI immediately left the bar and took leave for my hotel. Next day we took the plane back to home, I was alone, felt really ostracized, didn't talk to them during the fly while they were exchaning words and talked job things.\n\nSupposed to go back to office this Monday, at one hand not so sure I want to go back there, on the other hand I blame myself for not handling the situation well and not having proper social skills to navigate through these tough situations. Maybe I should've bought a hooker without really consuming her? Just to bamboozle them into thinking I did as them?",1336nxm,2331,1682802224

This new job will be a bit of a career shift, where I’ll be doing something that’s more closely related to my university degree. Not gonna lie, I’m a quite nervous, but hopefully it’ll turn out alright. :)",15ncdr5,2255,1691673648

They clock in overtime just to see their “passion projects” through. (Questionable.)\n\nSeveral people said “nothing” surprised them, and they seemed rather bored.

My team is understaffed by 40% and as such I finally received a 70% raise recently, which I am extremely grateful for.\n\n*However*, I just received a job offer that pays an additional ~15% base pay plus a yearly ~10% bonus for a total of $~110k/year. It’s also overtime exempt, whereas my current position is OT eligible and I get a fair amount of it throughout the year.\n\nI’m nervous about taking this risk, as my current supervisor is very lax, let’s us get projects done on our own time, let’s us take time off whenever, and isn’t a stickler for being on-time, leaving early, etc. Basically, I can do whatever I want here (within reason) and I feel like that flexibility may be worth more than the extra pay.\n\nI know money isn’t everything, but with how expensive everything is now (especially in my area) I’m tempted to take it. I just would hate to leave for ~20% more money and potentially 40% more workload and less work/life balance.\n\nThoughts or suggestions on this?\n\nThanks in advance (:\n\nEDIT: My pay increase was partially due to me receiving a previous offer from another company. I should’ve been more specific about that in my post.\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you all for your responses! I have decided to decline the offer with the new employer and will be staying in my current position. Yes, it sucks that it took getting a new job offer for me to get a raise but it’s worked in my favor and my employer’s.

Can I rescind?","During the interviews they said I can work fully remote and we agreed on a certain start date.\n\nAfter signing the contract offer, the future boss called me and heavily pressured me to talk to my current boss and negotiate a shorter notice period so I can start in ideally two weeks. We initially agreed that my start date would be in a few months. I said this likely won't be possible but future boss pushed back and said something along the lines of 'we already have plenty of work for you now, and if you don't start now, it will pile up for you'.\n\nDuring interviews, future boss also said that it doesn't matter where I work and I can be fully remote. But during our post contract offer call, future boss told me that it is heavily preferred if I was in the office three times a week, which would mean that I move.\n\nSo now I want to rescind my signature, but I'm not sure the legality of it.

I posted on Reddit and got hundreds of responses. Only TWO people said to stay, everyone else said to run. Well, I decided to stay and after a couple initial weeks of regret and worry, last week got the promotion, raise, and bonus % increase - for a total package higher than the other offer. In fact, me threatening to leave really woke up the organization and they gave salary adjustments to almost everyone here. I get to keep a nice work-life balance, and stay with great coworkers and a boss who has my back. Why am I telling you this?

1090,I got fired today for being sick at work,"So I (16f) have been working as a lifeguard for 2 years now at the company that recently terminated me. I’ve never particularly liked the management at this job but i kept working because of the pay. Anyways today I was working a 4-9 shift at a neighborhood pool and was feeling quite fatigued and dizzy (the temperature was in the high 90s and it was very sunny outside) Usually this kind of weather is uncomfortable for me but nothing i can’t handle, but for some reason today It really took a toll on me and by 7 i was feeling exhausted and about ready to fall over.\n\nI told myself that i was going to have to call in to close early at 8 because i felt so bad (i have never once missed a shift or left early before today). 8 came around and i called the manager phone and explained how I felt too sick to be on stand and requested to close early. My manager then proceeded to insist that i stayed and said she had nobody to replace me with. We went back and forth for about ten minutes with her saying things like “i need you to just stick it out”. The conversation finally ended with me basically telling her that i couldn’t responsibly be on stand when i was feeling like this and that it was unethical of her to ask me to do so and that if this meant i would be fired then fine. \n\nI then closed the pool and left at about 8:15, she later sent me a text saying if i didn’t provide a doctors note within 3 days i would be fired. Getting a doctors note isn’t a problem but the question i have is if it’s even worth staying at the company after this interaction. I don’t particularly need the money i was just working because i like to have some sort of income source during the summer but now that school has started it’s not necessary for me to have a part time job",15qgrq9,2176,1691977393

They only mentioned it would be “somewhere inspiring.” I assumed maybe a trendy coffee shop or a creative co-working space.\n\nThe day of the interview arrived. I got a text with the location - it was a local amusement park. Confused, I called them to double-check, and they confirmed it wasn’t a mistake. So I showed up in my suit, holding my portfolio, looking completely out of place amidst families and kids in casual wear.\n\nWhen I met the interviewer, he purchased two tickets for the Ferris wheel. To say I was bewildered would be an understatement. But he assured me it was all part of their “unique interview process”. We hopped into one of the cabins, and as soon as we were at the top of the Ferris wheel, the interview began.\n\nHonestly, it was one of the most relaxed, engaging, and thoughtful interviews I’ve ever had. The interviewer explained that they believe in disrupting typical environments to foster creativity and unexpected conversations. We had some laughs, shared our views on work and life, and connected on a very human level.\n\nI’m still waiting to hear back about the job, but this was an experience I wanted to share.

I really worked hard for this. I worked my ass off, and now I finally got an offer and can leave my shitty job and my toxic work environment. The best part: I found a company that truly trusts its employees and offers a fully remote job, not just a home office job kinda situation where one has to kinda live in the same area to come once a week to the office. I even read, that these kinds of deals even get scrapped sometimes after signing the contract 'you know... home office isn't allowed anymore, you need to come back to the office.'   \n\n\nWHAT A JOKE!  \n\n\nThere are even companies supporting FULLY REMOTE, but then you are doing the interview, and they are questioning your remote motives: 'Why do you wanna work remotely?' Unbelievable.  \n\n\nI am here to tell you, that if you have a dream, and that dream isn't about living on Mars, and you read about people actually doing it, then DON'T EVER back down. If other people can do it, you can do it. You have a dream, FIGHT for it. WORK your ass off. Do whatever it takes and NEVER EVER GIVE UP! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt some point, I didn't care about being rejected, anymore. I just knew that it will happen at some point. With every interview with recruiters and companies, I  became better and better. In the end, I was a pro. I aced every interview and got to every last interview round. I started rejecting them, if companies expected me to make weird case studies for one hour.  I mean, think about it. A company doing several interviews and case studies, they are using people for consulting, FOR FREE. Imagine preparing for an hour-long presentation: We are talking about up to 20 hours of preparation (if you also need to get familiar with company specific and very complex products).\n\nGood thing that I was rejected, because the offer I have now is way better than every failed opportunity of the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess, the last thing I want to leave you with are some advices, that helped me get there, where I am right now:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Know exactly AND objectively where you are standing, both from a career point of view and from a salary point of view. Yes, I am talking about the career ladder. Most people don't even know what kind of career ladder they are standing on. This is important, in order to know what kind of salaries are even possible and what to aim for.\n* If you do something long enough, you will become a pro. Don't destroy your ambitions or your career ladder because of a toxic work environment or companies rejecting you. If you can objectively justify, that what you are doing right now is the right thing, then keep doing it. \n* It takes time. If you aim higher, it might take a while to get there. It might take several years. Always remember why you are doing what you are doing.\n* Improve yourself with every interview. Really ask yourself what you can do better. 'What should I keep doing and what shouldn't I keep doing?' If you do lots of these interviews, sooner or later you figure out what really is asked of you. ALWAYS be positive. Be selective with your truths and only share knowledge, that helps you get to the next interview round.\n* Learn how to negotiate your salary.\n* CV. I know, everyone got one. But the amount of bad CVs is just astonishing. Does your CV tell other people, that you are born for a certain role? Does your career 'make sense'? Do you use your own job titles, that comply to the job ladder you are on and not the ones companies make up? If you can't say yes to these questions, you need to work on your CV. Your CV isn't your Wikipedia page. Your CV must say: You are born for the role you are applying for.\n* Use LinkedIn. People use LinkedIn as their CV. I believe this is very wrong. LinkedIn should be used as a CV teaser and as a tool to connect to people from your industry. The only ones getting your real and more detailed CV are the ones meeting your criteria of a company you want to work for.",ty6va7,2102,1649313201
